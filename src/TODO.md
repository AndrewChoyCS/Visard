## TODO 
- Make general description more refined
- Do not pass visual description
- New Output should be simple graph based intial data prompt
- Pass this through a refine agent that makes the graph better
- After each refinement evaluate the visualization 
    - Have our own rubric, 
    - EX:  Socre based on interbility
    - Have a threshold for a score, and once the agent gives it a certain score, it is able to return

-  Create Synthetic data
    - 5-10 visulizations per prompt
    - have a judge to evaluate the best one based on features
    -
