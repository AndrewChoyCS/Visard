Perpendicular Lines â€“ Definition, Symbol, Properties, Examples
Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect, or meet, at a 90-degree angle (a right angle). 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Definition: Perpendicular lines form a right angle where they intersect. 
Right Angle: A right angle is exactly 90 degrees. 
Visual Representation: A small square is often used to indicate a right angle, and therefore, perpendicular lines. 
Examples:
The sides of a square or rectangle are perpendicular. 
The intersection of a wall and a floor. 
The letter "T". 
The intersection of roads at an intersection. 
Opposite of Perpendicular: The opposite of perpendicular lines are parallel lines, which never intersect.

2025-04-08 14:27:59,343 - INFO - Goal Explorer Output: The goal of the visualization project is to create an interactive, 3D diagram that effectively illustrates the concept of perpendicular lines, highlighting their definition, properties, and visual representation. The diagram will feature a square, rectangle, and "T" symbol to demonstrate the intersection of perpendicular lines, as well as a floor, wall, and road intersection to showcase real-world applications. By incorporating animations and interactive elements, the visualization will reveal the relationships between right angles, perpendicular lines, and parallel lines, allowing students to explore and understand the fundamental principles of Geometry. This interactive visualization will aid students in developing a deeper understanding of spatial relationships and geometric concepts, ultimately enhancing their problem-solving skills and confidence in applying Geometry to real-world problems. By providing a comprehensive and engaging visual representation of perpendicular lines, the project aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and tangible, real-world applications.

  "Description": "The visualization features a 3D cityscape with a square, rectangle, and 'T' symbol. A floor, wall, and road intersection is depicted to showcase real-world applications. Perpendicular lines are illustrated by drawing lines that intersect at right angles. As students interact with the visualization, the lines change color and opacity to highlight their relationships.
