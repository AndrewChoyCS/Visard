Perpendicular Lines – Definition, Symbol, Properties, Examples
Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect, or meet, at a 90-degree angle (a right angle). 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Definition: Perpendicular lines form a right angle where they intersect. 
Right Angle: A right angle is exactly 90 degrees. 
Visual Representation: A small square is often used to indicate a right angle, and therefore, perpendicular lines. 
Examples:
The sides of a square or rectangle are perpendicular. 
The intersection of a wall and a floor. 
The letter "T". 
The intersection of roads at an intersection. 
Opposite of Perpendicular: The opposite of perpendicular lines are parallel lines, which never intersect.

2025-04-08 14:04:18,332 - INFO - Goal Explorer Output: The visualization goal for Gradient Descent is to illustrate the process of minimizing the loss function through iterative updates of the model parameters, with a focus on the relationship between the gradient, the learning rate, and the parameter updates. 

This visualization will make visible the concept of gradient descent as a series of perpendicular lines, where each iteration represents a step towards the optimal solution, and the learning rate controls the steepness of the descent. 

By highlighting the relationship between the gradient and the parameter updates, the visualization will address common misconceptions about the direction of gradient descent, such as the idea that the algorithm moves in a straight line. 

A successful visualization will demonstrate an understanding of the iterative process, the role of the learning rate, and the convergence of the algorithm towards the optimal solution.
