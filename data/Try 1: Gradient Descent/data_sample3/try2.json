    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Gradient Descent as a Process of Minimization\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of Gradient Descent as a process for finding the minimum cost in a cost function represented by a bowl. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how different values of coefficients relate to the varying costs at different positions on the surface of the bowl. This should clarify how the iterative process of selecting new coefficients leads toward the bottom of the bowl, which signifies the minimum cost. \n\nThe visualization should effectively show the relationships between the current position on the bowl, the corresponding cost, and the movement toward the optimal coefficients through arrows or pathways that denote the iterative steps taken. Appropriate styles could include a 3D diagram of the bowl with gradient arrows or a step-by-step infographic illustrating the process of testing and selecting coefficients. This aids in understanding the cause-effect relationship inherent in Gradient Descent, making the learning experience more intuitive and visually engaging.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how Gradient Descent operates as an optimization technique, recognizing the iterative relationship between coefficient choices and cost evaluation that guides them toward the minimum cost in a cost function.",
