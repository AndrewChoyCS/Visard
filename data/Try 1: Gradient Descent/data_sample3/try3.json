    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of finding optimal coefficients in a cost function using gradient descent, represented by the analogy of a bowl where variations in coefficients influence the cost associated with their positions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent using the analogy of a bowl representing a cost function. The visualization should illustrate how different positions on the bowl surface correspond to varying costs associated with coefficient values, ultimately guiding learners to the minimum cost at the bowl\u2019s bottom. It should highlight the sequential process of adjusting coefficients, evaluating costs, and iteratively moving towards the optimal solution. An infographic style would be effective for this purpose, incorporating both a 3D bowl representation (to depict the cost function) and arrows to show the iterative path taken by the coefficients. By visually connecting the coefficients' movement to lower costs and the goal of reaching the bowl\u2019s minimum, the visualization will enhance comprehension of the iterative nature and mechanics of gradient descent.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will gain a deep and crucial understanding of gradient descent by visualizing the relationship between coefficients and cost, recognizing the iterative process of minimizing cost, and effectively connecting abstract mathematical concepts to intuitive real-world analogies.",
