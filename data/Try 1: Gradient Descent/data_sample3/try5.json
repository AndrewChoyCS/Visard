    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The goal of gradient descent is to find the lowest point (minimum cost) on the cost function by iteratively adjusting coefficients based on their associated costs.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent using a bowl-shaped graph as a representation of the cost function. The visualization should illustrate various positions on the bowl's surface, each indicating different cost values associated with specific coefficient sets. It should clearly show the iterative process of adjusting coefficients to find lower costs, ultimately leading to the bottom of the bowl\u2014the minimum cost point. \n\nThis should include labeled sections highlighting each adjustment step and the corresponding cost. Consider using an infographic style that combines a 3D bowl diagram with arrowed paths indicating movement toward the minimum. This visual should clarify the sequential process of optimization in gradient descent, highlighting cause-effect relationships between coefficient adjustments and changes in cost, and providing a deep understanding of how iterative refinement leads to convergence on the minimum cost.\n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners can effectively visualize and articulate the iterative nature of gradient descent, grasping how each adjustment in coefficients leads toward achieving the minimum cost within a cost function's landscape.",
