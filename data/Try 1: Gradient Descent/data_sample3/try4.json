    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe iterative process of gradient descent as a method for minimizing the cost function, represented visually as navigating a bowl to find its lowest point.\n\n### Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent using the metaphor of navigating a bowl. The visual should depict the bowl representing the cost function with a gradient that shows varying cost values at different positions. Illustrate the starting point (random position on the bowl), the movement towards lower costs, and the eventual convergence at the bottom of the bowl where the minimum cost occurs. This visualization should aim to clarify how each iteration selects new coefficients based on their evaluation, leading to a gradual descent towards the optimal solution. \n\nUtilize a combination of diagrams and animations to show the path taken towards the minimum, highlighting how small adjustments lead to reduced costs. By visually representing the relationship between the coefficient adjustments and their impact on cost, learners will develop a deeper understanding of the algorithm\u2019s mechanics in an engaging and intuitive way.\n\n### Learning Objective\nStudents will be able to illustrate and explain the iterative nature of gradient descent, recognizing how successive evaluations of coefficients lead to an increasingly lower cost, ultimately aiding in identifying the optimal solution within a complex cost landscape.",
