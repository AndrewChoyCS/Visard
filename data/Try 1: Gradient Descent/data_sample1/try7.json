    "data": "Gradient descent is a method for unconstrained mathematical optimization. It is a first-order iterative algorithm for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a trajectory that maximizes that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. It is particularly useful in machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of gradient descent and ascent as iterative optimization methods that rely on the direction of the gradient.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent and ascent in mathematical optimization. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the gradient direction and optimization outcomes through a series of graphical representations showing a multivariate function on a 3D surface. It can depict a path of descent representing gradient descent as descending along the steepest slope, contrasted with a path representing gradient ascent as ascending along the gradient. The goal is to clarify how these iterative steps lead to local minima or maxima, helping learners understand the principle behind choosing the direction of movement in optimization tasks. \n\nBy utilizing a combination of a 3D surface graph and annotated trajectory lines, the visual will aid learners in recognizing the cause-effect relationship between the gradient's direction and the optimization results. An infographic style will facilitate a clear sequence of steps involved in the gradient descent/ascent process, thereby enhancing comprehension.\n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners deeply grasp the iterative nature of gradient descent and ascent, enabling them to analyze how the gradient's direction influences the optimization path, ultimately applying this understanding to real-world machine learning scenarios effectively.",
