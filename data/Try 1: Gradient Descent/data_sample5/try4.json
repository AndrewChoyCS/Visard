    "data": "Gradient descent is an optimization technique used primarily for unconstrained problems. This first-order iterative method aims to minimize a multivariate function that is differentiable. The process involves repeatedly moving in the contrary direction of the gradient (or an estimated gradient) from the current point, since this leads to the steepest descent. In contrast, moving along the direction of the gradient will pursue the upward slope of the function, a practice known as gradient ascent. This method is especially beneficial in machine learning as it helps in reducing the cost or loss associated with a function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe iterative process of gradient descent as a method for minimizing a multivariate differentiable function by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as it minimizes a multivariate differentiable function. The goal is to illustrate how the process involves moving repeatedly in the opposite direction of the gradient, demonstrating the concept of steepest descent and contrasting it with gradient ascent. The visualization should clearly depict the progression of points along the optimization path in a three-dimensional graph representing the multivariate function, highlighting the moving \"steps\" downwards vs. the upward slope of gradient ascent. Incorporating a flowchart that simplifies the steps involved in the iterative process will aid learners in understanding cause-effect relationships within the optimization process. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include the mastery of the iterative nature of gradient descent, comprehension of the contrasting principles of ascent and descent, and application of this knowledge to real-world machine learning contexts. Visualizing the relationships and sequences involved enhances students' ability to grasp the dynamics of optimization in a multi-dimensional environment, leading to a deeper and practical understanding of this foundational concept in machine learning.",
