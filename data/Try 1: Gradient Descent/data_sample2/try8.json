    "data": "One thing to note, however, is that the techniques we used above can only be applied if we make some big assumptions. For the calculus approach, we assumed that the loss function was differentiable at all points and that we could algebraically solve for the zero points of the derivative; for the geometric approach, OLS *only* applies when using a linear model with MSE loss. What happens when we have more complex models with different, more complex loss functions? The techniques we've learned so far will not work, so we need a new optimization technique: **gradient descent**. Looking at the function across this domain, it is clear that the function's minimum value occurs around $\\theta = 5.3$. Let's pretend for a moment that we *couldn't* see the full view of the cost function. How would we guess the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes the function? Let's consider an arbitrary function. Our goal is to find the value of $x$ that minimizes this function.```def arbitrary(x): return (x**4 - 15*x**3 + 80*x**2 - 180*x + 144)/10 It turns out that the first derivative of the function can give us a clue. In the graph below, the function and its derivative are plotted, with points where the derivative is equal to 0 plotted in light green. > **BIG IDEA**: use an iterative algorithm to numerically compute the minimum of the loss.Looking at the function across this domain, it is clear that the function's minimum value occurs around $\\theta = 5.3$.

It turns out that the first derivative of the function can give us a clue. In the graph below, the function and its derivative are plotted, with points where the derivative is equal to 0 plotted in light green.Say we make a guess for the minimizing value of $\\theta$. Remember that we read plots from left to right, and assume that our starting $\\theta$ value is to the left of the optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$. If the guess undershoots the true minimizing value \u2013 our guess for $\\theta$ is lower than the value of the $\\hat{\\theta}$ that minimizes the function \u2013 the derivative will be **negative**. This means that if we increase $\\theta$ (move further to the right), then we **can decrease** our loss function further. If this guess overshoots the true minimizing value, the derivative will be positive, implying the converse. We can use this pattern to help formulate our next guess for the optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$. Consider the case where we've undershot $\\theta$ by guessing too low of a value. We'll want our next guess to be greater in value than our previous guess \u2013 that is, we want to shift our guess to the right. You can think of this as following the slope downhill to the function's minimum value.If we've overshot $\\hat{\\theta}$ by guessing too high of a value, we'll want our next guess to be lower in value \u2013 we want to shift our guess for $\\hat{\\theta}$ to the left.",
    "goal": "### Query for Visualization Expert\n\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative optimization technique.** The goal is to depict how gradient descent helps find the minimum value of a complex function by using the first derivative to guide the search process. The visualization should clarify the cause-effect relationship between the current guess for the variable \\( \\theta \\) and the direction to adjust it\u2014either increasing or decreasing based on the derivative's sign. \n\nTo effectively illustrate this, consider using a line graph showing the arbitrary function alongside its derivative. Mark the points where the derivative equals zero with distinct visual elements (e.g., light green dots), and use arrows to indicate the direction of adjustment needed for different guesses (undershooting and overshooting the minimum). This will enhance understanding of how to navigate the optimization landscape and make clear the sequential decision-making process inherent in gradient descent.\n\n### Educational Objective\nDevelop a deep understanding of how gradient descent operates by visualizing the relationship between the function\u2019s behavior and the adjustments made to the guess for \\( \\theta \\). This will reinforce the iterative nature of the technique and highlight the critical thinking required to successfully converge on the minimum value of a loss function, ultimately fostering learners' proficiency in applying optimization techniques in real-world scenarios.",
