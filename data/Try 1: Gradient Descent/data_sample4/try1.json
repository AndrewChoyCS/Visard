    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between the learning rate (\u03b7) and the convergence behavior of the Gradient Descent Algorithm.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the impact of the learning rate (\u03b7) on the convergence of the Gradient Descent Algorithm. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how varying the learning rate affects the step size and overall behavior of the algorithm, such as convergence speed and the risk of diverging. This visualization should illustrate the relationship between the learning rate, the computed gradient, and the subsequent steps taken in the minimization process.\n\nI suggest using a combination of a line graph and a flowchart: the line graph should depict multiple convergence paths with different learning rates, highlighting cases where the algorithm converges smoothly, diverges, or oscillates. The flowchart should outline the sequential steps of the Gradient Descent process, integrating visual cues that represent the effect of the learning rate at each stage. \n\nThis visualization will aid in understanding by clearly illustrating cause-effect relationships, especially how a high learning rate leads to large, potentially erratic steps, while a low learning rate results in more cautious, gradual convergence. It aims to deepen learners' interpretive skills regarding how adjustments to \u03b7 can optimize or undermine the effectiveness of a Gradient Descent strategy.\n\n**Learning Objective:** To achieve a comprehensive understanding of how learning rate adjustments influence the efficiency and success of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, enabling students to make informed decisions about parameter tuning in machine learning.",
