    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative step calculation in the Gradient Descent algorithm, which involves using the current gradient, the learning rate, and the subtraction of the scaled gradient to minimize a function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the algorithm calculates the next point by utilizing the gradient from the current position, scaling it with the learning rate, and making a subtraction step to reach the minimum of the function. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the learning rate, step size, and convergence behavior of the algorithm. \n\nTo effectively represent these concepts, an infographic or flowchart style is recommended, displaying each step of the process in a sequential and hierarchical manner, highlighting key variables such as the gradient, learning rate, and updated position. Incorporating graphs that show the convergence paths under different learning rates (both too small and too large) would deepen the understanding of how these factors influence the optimization process.\n\n**Educational Objective:** The objective is to provide a clear visual representation that enhances the learner's comprehension of the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent algorithm, emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships between learning rate adjustments and convergence behavior. This will facilitate a deeper understanding of the impact of parameter choices in optimization processes.",
