    "goal": "For the visualization, I would create a static diagram that compares the convergence rates of different minimization algorithms on a simple optimization problem. The diagram would consist of several panels that illustrate the behavior of each algorithm as it iterates towards the minimum.\n\n**Panel 1: Introduction**\n\nThe first panel would introduce the optimization problem and the algorithms being compared. It would include a simple function (e.g., a quadratic function) that represents the optimization problem. This would help students understand the context of the comparison.\n\n**Panel 2: Convergence Rates**\n\nThe second panel would compare the convergence rates of the different algorithms. Each algorithm would be represented by a line or curve that shows how the objective function value changes over time. The algorithms would be labeled (e.g., Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, Quasi-Newton Method). The x-axis would represent the number of iterations, and the y-axis would represent the objective function value.\n\n**Panel 3: Comparison of Algorithms**\n\nThe third panel would provide a more detailed comparison of the convergence rates. Each algorithm would be represented by a different line or curve, with the following characteristics:\n\n* Gradient Descent: a slow but stable curve, indicating that it converges slowly but reliably.\n* Newton's Method: a faster but less stable curve, indicating that it converges quickly but may oscillate.\n* Quasi-Newton Methods: a faster and more stable curve, indicating that they converge quickly and reliably.\n\n**Panel 4: Error Analysis**\n\nThe fourth panel would analyze the error introduced by each algorithm. The error would be represented by a small circle or square that moves away from the minimum as the algorithm iterates. The size of the circle or square would represent the magnitude of the error. This would help students understand the trade-off between convergence rate and error.\n\n**Panel 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe final panel would summarize the key findings and provide a conclusion. It would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and provide recommendations for choosing the best algorithm for a given problem.\n\nThroughout the visualization, I would use clear and concise labels, arrows, and annotations to help students understand the behavior of each algorithm. The diagram would be designed to be easy to read and understand, with plenty of whitespace to avoid clutter. The visualization would be accompanied by a brief explanation of each algorithm and their convergence rates, to provide context and help students understand the results.",
