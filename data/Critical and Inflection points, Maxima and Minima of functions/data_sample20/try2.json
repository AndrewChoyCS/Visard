    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\n**The relationship between the time, height, and slope of a projectile's motion, particularly identifying the maximum height through the concept of derivatives.**\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between time, height, and the slope of a projectile's motion as described by the equation h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. The visual should depict the height of the projectile over time with a curve representing the height function, highlighting the point where the slope (derivative) equals zero to indicate the maximum height. Include critical annotations that mark the time of 1.25 seconds and the corresponding height of 7 meters.\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify how the slope of the function changes over time and to illustrate the concept of critical points where the projectile reaches its peak height. Use a line graph style with clear axes to show the height as a function of time, alongside an annotated tangent line that depicts the slope at different points. This design will help learners understand the relationship between time and height, as well as the significance of derivatives in identifying maxima.\n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify and understand the significance of critical points in a function.\n2. Relate the physical motion of the projectile to mathematical concepts such as derivatives and maxima.\n3. Visualize the behavior of quadratic functions and comprehend the implications of their slopes in real-world contexts. \n\nThis visualization will promote a deep and crucial understanding of how derivatives inform us about the characteristics of a function, particularly in the context of projectile motion.",
