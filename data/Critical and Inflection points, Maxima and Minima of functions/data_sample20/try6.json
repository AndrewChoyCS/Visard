    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Relationship Between the Derivative of a Function and Its Maximum Height**\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how the derivative of the height function \\( h(t) = 2 + 10t - 4t^2 \\) reflects the changing slope of a projectile's height over time, ultimately leading to its peak height. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the height of the projectile, time, and the slope represented by the derivative \\( h'(t) = 10 - 8t \\). Use a graph that displays both the height function and its derivative on the same axes, marking the point where the derivative equals zero and indicating the maximum height reached by the projectile. This will clarify how the concepts of critical points and maxima/minima in calculus apply to real-world scenarios. The expected educational outcomes are an understanding of how to analyze the slope through derivatives, identification of critical points, and recognition of their significance in determining maximum values.\n\nBy visualizing both the height function and its derivative, learners will be better equipped to comprehend the dynamic relationship between position and motion, enhancing their grasp of the derivative\u2019s role in optimization problems in calculus. This approach aligns with best practices in instructional design by sequentially illustrating cause-effect relationships and promoting deeper insight into the connectedness of these mathematical concepts.",
