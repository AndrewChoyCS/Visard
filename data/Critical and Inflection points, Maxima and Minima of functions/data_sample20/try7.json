    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The relationship between derivatives and the maximum height of a projectile in motion.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the function representing height changes over time and how this change is captured by the slope (derivative). Specifically, it should clarify the relationship between the slope of the function, the point at which it equals zero, and the calculation of maximum height. \n\nUse a multi-part diagram that includes a graph of the height function \\( h(t) = 2 + 10t - 4t^2 \\), indicating the trajectory of the projectile, along with a separate graph to show the slope function \\( h'(t) = 10 - 8t \\). Highlight the critical point where the slope equals zero, denoting the maximum height on the height graph. \n\nThis visual representation will deepen learners' understanding by clearly illustrating the cause-effect relationship between the derivative of the height function and the identification of maximum height. The integration of both graphs allows for a clear comparison of how the height and its rate of change interact over time, enhancing the instructional design by sequentially guiding learners through the concepts of maxima and minima in the context of projectile motion.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to analyze the height of a projectile through calculus concepts, specifically by determining maxima and minima via derivatives, thereby fostering critical thinking in interpreting functional relationships in physics.",
