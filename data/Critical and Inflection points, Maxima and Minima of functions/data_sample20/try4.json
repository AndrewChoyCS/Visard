    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The maximum height of a projectile can be determined using the derivative of its height function, which allows us to find critical points where the slope equals zero.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how to determine the maximum height of a projectile using its height function and derivatives. The goal of the visualization is to clarify the relationship between the height of the projectile as a function of time, the derivative that represents the slope, and the identification of critical points where the projectile reaches its peak height. This visualization should incorporate a dynamic graph illustrating the height function over time, overlaying a secondary graph of the derivative to show how the slope changes, and clearly highlight where the slope equals zero, indicating the maximum height at 1.25 seconds. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of an infographic or an interactive diagram, employing color coding to differentiate between the height function and its derivative. By making the visual connections between the height and the slope clear, learners will better understand how the derivative informs the finding of maxima and how critical points are assessed graphically.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to interpret the relationship between a function and its derivative to identify critical points, explain how to mathematically determine the maximum height of a projectile, and connect graphical representations of these concepts to gain a deeper understanding of maxima and minima in calculus.",
