    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the height of a projectile, its time of ascent, and the calculation of its maximum height using derivatives to find critical points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of calculating the peak height of a projectile thrown upward, illustrated through the equation h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. The goal is to clarify how derivatives are used to identify the point where the slope of the height function equals zero, ultimately indicating the maximum height of the projectile. This visualization should show the relationship between time (t), height (h), and the derivative of the height function (h'), emphasizing the identification of the inflection point at t = 1.25 seconds and the maximum height of 7 meters. \n\nConsider using a combination of a 2D graph depicting the height as a parabolic curve with labeled axes, an overlay indicating the derivative function as a line graph, and a highlighted point marking the critical point. This dual visualization approach helps in understanding the sequential progression from the projectile's motion to the calculations involved in determining its maximum height. \n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visual representation, learners will grasp the interconnectedness of the concepts of maxima, minima, and critical points in functions, enhancing their ability to analyze projectile motion and apply similar principles in various contexts.",
