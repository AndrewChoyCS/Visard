    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between the time variable and the height of a projectile, particularly identifying the maximum height through the use of derivatives and critical points.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain how the height of a projectile changes over time and the significance of finding the maximum height using derivatives. The visualization should illustrate the parabolic trajectory of the projectile and highlight the critical point where the slope (rate of change) is zero, indicating the peak height. It should include a graph showing the height as a function of time, with clearly marked axes, the equation of the function, and annotations highlighting the point (1.25 seconds, 7 m) where the maximum height occurs. \n\nThis visualization should incorporate a line graph style, integrating elements such as color coding or highlighting to differentiate the sections of the graph and the critical point. The goal is to clarify the cause-effect relationship between time and height, emphasizing how derivatives help locate the maximum point in a parabolic graph. \n\n**Educational Outcome**: Students should understand how to analyze polynomial functions using derivatives, recognize critical points, and visualize the concepts of maxima and minima in real-world scenarios, deepening their comprehension of motion under gravity.",
