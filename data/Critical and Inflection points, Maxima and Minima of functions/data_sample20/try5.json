    "data": "Consider this situation: A projectile is thrown upward. The height (h) of the projectile at any time (t) can be represented by the equation: h = 2 + 10t \u2212 4t\u00b2. We can determine its peak height by using derivatives to find the function's slope: h' = 0 + 10 - 8t. To locate the time at which the slope becomes zero, we set up the equation: 10 - 8t = 0 meaning 8t = 10, thereby t = 10 / 8 = 1.25 seconds. The slope equals zero at t = 1.25 seconds, which allows us to calculate the height at that instant: h = 2 + 10x1.25 - 4x(1.25)\u00b2 equals h = 2 + 12.5 - 7.5, resulting in maximum height h = 7. This indicates that the highest point reached by the projectile is 7 m, occurring at 1.25 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile using calculus, specifically through the identification of critical points where the derivative equals zero.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of determining the peak height of a projectile using its height equation, \\( h = 2 + 10t - 4t\u00b2 \\), and its derivative. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the function's slope helps identify the maximum height reached by the projectile at a specific time (1.25 seconds) and how this corresponds to the height of 7 meters. This visual will clarify the relationship between the height equation and its derivative, demonstrating the transition from a positive slope to zero and then to a negative slope, which indicates a maximum point. \n\nThe visualization should consist of a parabolic graph representing the height function over time, with annotations showing the derivative and key points of interest (such as the inflection and critical points). Incorporate graphs or diagrams that depict the slope of the tangent line at various points, particularly highlighting where the slope equals zero. This approach allows learners to understand the cause-and-effect relationships in calculus that lead to finding maxima in a tangible and engaging way.\n\n**Objective:** Students will deeply understand how derivatives can be used to determine maximum points of a function, specifically in the context of projectile motion. They will be able to identify critical points of a function graphically and connect these points to physical interpretations in motion dynamics.",
