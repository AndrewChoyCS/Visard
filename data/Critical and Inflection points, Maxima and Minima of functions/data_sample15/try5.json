    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The first-order derivative test helps identify local maxima, minima, and inflection points based on the behavior of the first derivative of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for determining local maxima, minima, and inflection points of a function. The visualization should clearly illustrate the critical point c where the first derivative f'(c) = 0, and demonstrate how changes in the sign of f'(x) indicate whether c is a local maximum, minimum, or an inflection point. Specific focus should be given to depicting the transition of the first derivative's sign around the critical point and how this relates to the function's behavior.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a multi-part infographic or a series of annotated graphs. It should highlight the cause-effect relationships among the critical point, the slope (first derivative), and the nature of the curve, guiding learners through the process step-by-step. By integrating contrasting graphs of the function and its derivative, the visual will deepen understanding, making it clearer how the derivative's sign influences the classification of the critical point.\n\n**Objective:** The goal of this visualization is to deepen the learner's understanding of the first-order derivative test for identifying maxima, minima, and inflection points, reinforcing the connection between function behavior and its derivatives through clear visual relationships and sequential processes.",
