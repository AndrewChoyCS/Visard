    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Understanding how the first-order derivative test determines local maxima, minima, and inflection points based on the behavior of the first derivative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of using the first-order derivative test to identify critical points on a function. The visualization should illustrate how to compute the first derivative and analyze its sign changes at critical points to determine whether each point is classified as a local maximum, local minimum, or inflection point. This should clearly depict the relationships between the values of the first derivative, the function itself, and how these influence the classification of the critical points.\n\nThe visual representation should take the form of a layered infographic, showing graphs of the function and its first derivative. Include labeled critical points and arrows indicating the transition of the first derivative's sign. Highlight relationships by using color coding: for example, green for increasing sections, red for decreasing sections, and a neutral color for inflection points. This will aid learners in comprehending how the behavior of the first derivative directly impacts the classification of critical points, supporting a deeper grasp of concepts related to maxima, minima, and inflection points.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Enhance the learner\u2019s ability to analyze functions and interpret first-order derivatives by clearly illustrating how sign changes in the derivative correspond to maxima, minima, and inflection points, thereby fostering a stronger conceptual understanding of critical points in calculus.",
