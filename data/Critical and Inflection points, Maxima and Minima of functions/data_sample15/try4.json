    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Role of the First Derivative in Identifying Local Maxima, Minima, and Inflection Points**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points within a continuous function. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between the first derivative and the behavior of the function near critical points. This visualization should clarify how transitions in the sign of the first derivative indicate whether a critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or inflection point.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a graph with labeled axes representing the function and its first derivative. Key points should be highlighted to indicate locations of critical points, with arrows or color coding to show the transitions of the first derivative's signs (positive to negative, negative to positive, or unchanged). This clear visual representation will help students understand the cause-effect relationship between the first derivative and the nature of the curve, enhancing their grasp of how these mathematical concepts interact.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will be able to accurately determine and articulate the significance of local maxima, minima, and inflection points in a function by analyzing the first derivative, deepening their comprehension of calculus concepts through visual learning and critical thinking.",
