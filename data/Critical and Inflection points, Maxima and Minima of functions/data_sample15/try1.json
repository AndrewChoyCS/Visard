    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The First-Order Derivative Test for Identifying Maxima, Minima, and Inflection Points.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the First-Order Derivative Test and its role in determining local maxima, minima, and inflection points of a continuous function. The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate how changes in the sign of the first derivative around a critical point reveal the nature of that point. Specifically, the visualization should depict three scenarios: the transition of the first derivative from positive to negative (indicating a local maximum), from negative to positive (indicating a local minimum), and no change in sign (indicating an inflection point). \n\nA combined line graph and labeled axes can effectively convey the relationships between the function's slope and its critical points. This approach allows for easy comparison of the slopes and corresponding value changes, enhancing the learner's understanding of these concepts through a sequential representation of how a function behaves around critical points. \n\n**Educational Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of how the First-Order Derivative Test functions, enabling them to accurately identify and interpret local maxima, minima, and inflection points within mathematical contexts.",
