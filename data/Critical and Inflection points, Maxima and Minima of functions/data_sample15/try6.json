    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The first-order derivative test distinguishes local maxima and minima by analyzing the sign changes of the first derivative at critical points.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test as a tool for identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points in a continuous function. The goal is to clarify how the sign of the first derivative (f'(x)) changes around critical points and how these changes inform us about the behavior of the function at those points. The visualization should focus on the relationships between positive and negative derivatives, clearly marking local maxima, local minima, and inflection points using graphs and arrows to represent slope and transitions in sign. An ideal style could be a combination of a labeled function graph and an infographic to indicate the critical points and their significance. This visual will deepen understanding by illustrating how derivative behavior directly correlates to function characteristics, helping learners grasp the underlying mathematical concepts.\n\n**Learning Objective:** \nStudents will be able to analyze the first-order derivative of a continuous function to identify and interpret local maxima, minima, and inflection points, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the function's slope and its critical points.",
