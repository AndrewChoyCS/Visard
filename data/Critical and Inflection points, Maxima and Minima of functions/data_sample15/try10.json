    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine maxima and minima points for a function. By calculating the first derivative, we can ascertain the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l, where the condition f'(c) = 0 holds. To ascertain the nature of the curve, we explore several scenarios as x approaches the critical point c. If the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, this indicates that f(c) represents the highest value, and c is identified as a local maximum. Conversely, if the sign shifts from negative to positive, f(c) depicts the lowest value, and c marks a point of local minimum. In the case where the sign of f'(x) remains unchanged, neither transitioning from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, c is described as an inflection point, identifying a space that is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\nThe first-order derivative test determines local maxima, minima, and inflection points of a continuous function by analyzing the behavior of the first derivative around critical points.\n\n### Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the process of identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points using the first-order derivative test.** The goal is to illustrate how changes in the sign of the first derivative at critical points indicate whether the critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or an inflection point. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the first derivative, its sign changes, and the corresponding nature of the function at those points. Consider using a combination of line graphs to represent the function and its derivative, clearly labeling regions of increase, decrease, and the types of critical points. \n\nThe visualization will help learners visually grasp the cause-effect relationships that dictate the behavior of a function around critical points, enhancing their understanding of function behavior and providing a practical tool for applying the first-order derivative test. \n\n### Educational Outcome\nStudents will be able to identify and describe local maxima and minima, as well as inflection points of a function by analyzing the behavior of the first derivative, ultimately improving their skills in calculus and function analysis. By visualizing these concepts, learners can develop a deeper understanding of how derivatives influence the shape and characteristics of functions.",
