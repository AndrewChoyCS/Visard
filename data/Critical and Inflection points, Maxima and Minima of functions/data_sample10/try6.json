    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve an absolute (or global) maximum at a point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its domain. Conversely, we call a point x = c a relative (or local) maximum if, in some open interval around x = c, f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). Similarly, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c when f(x) is equal to or greater than f(c) across its entire domain. Additionally, a point x = c is identified as a relative (or local) minimum if, within some open interval surrounding x = c, f(x) maintains a value equal to or exceeding f(c).",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, including their definitions and how they differ based on the function's domain.\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function, f(x). The goal is to visually differentiate between the locations where a function achieves maximum or minimum values in both a global and local context. The visualization should include two separate graphs: one demonstrating the absolute maximum and minimum across the function's entire domain, and another illustrating local maxima and minima within localized intervals. Use colorful annotations to highlight the points of interest (c) on the graphs and label the regions where f(x) is greater than or less than f(c). This visual representation aims to deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of the relationships between these points and the overall shape of the function.\n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nStudents will be able to distinguish between absolute and relative extrema and accurately identify them within the context of function behaviors. The visualization will simplify the concept of maxima and minima by providing clear visual contexts that show key relationships and the sequential nature of function evaluations that lead to these critical points. By integrating distinct graphs with explicit labels, learners gain insights into the different scenarios where maxima and minima occur, fostering a deeper conceptual comprehension of critical and inflection points.",
