    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve an absolute (or global) maximum at a point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its domain. Conversely, we call a point x = c a relative (or local) maximum if, in some open interval around x = c, f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). Similarly, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c when f(x) is equal to or greater than f(c) across its entire domain. Additionally, a point x = c is identified as a relative (or local) minimum if, within some open interval surrounding x = c, f(x) maintains a value equal to or exceeding f(c).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, along with their definitions and implications.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the differences between absolute and relative extrema clearly by showcasing various functions and their corresponding peaks and valleys. It should include labeled graphs that highlight global maximum and minimum points across the entire domain, and local maximum and minimum points within specific intervals. \n\nThe visualization will employ a combination of graphical line plots and shaded areas to emphasize the areas where the function achieves these maxima and minima. This approach helps clarify the relationships between points on the graph and their classifications as absolute or relative extrema. Furthermore, the visual will aid students in understanding cause-effect relationships, specifically how changes in input values impact function values, thereby deepening their insight into critical and inflection points.\n\n**Objective:** Students will understand and identify the differences between absolute and relative extrema in functions, enabling them to analyze functional behavior critically and apply these concepts in calculus and real-world scenarios.",
