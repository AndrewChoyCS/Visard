    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve an absolute (or global) maximum at a point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its domain. Conversely, we call a point x = c a relative (or local) maximum if, in some open interval around x = c, f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). Similarly, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c when f(x) is equal to or greater than f(c) across its entire domain. Additionally, a point x = c is identified as a relative (or local) minimum if, within some open interval surrounding x = c, f(x) maintains a value equal to or exceeding f(c).",
    "goal": "### Core Principle: Distinction Between Absolute and Relative Maxima and Minima\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function \\( f(x) \\). The goal of this visualization is to depict a function graphically, highlighting points of absolute and relative maxima and minima with clearly labeled intervals. By illustrating the function's behavior across its domain, this visual representation should clarify how absolute maxima and minima are determined across the entire function, while relative maxima and minima depend on local neighborhoods. \n\nI suggest using a graphing style that overlays multiple curves to show contrasts between global and local behaviors, accompanied by annotations that define these points in context. This visual should not only represent the relationships between different maxima and minima but also emphasize their hierarchical significance\u2014showing learners how global maxima and minima serve as overarching constraints on local behaviors. \n\n### Learning Objective:\nBy the end of the visualization, learners will achieve a deep understanding of the critical differences between absolute and relative extrema, discerning the conditions under which each occurs, thereby enhancing their abilities to analyze functions and identify maxima and minima effectively.",
