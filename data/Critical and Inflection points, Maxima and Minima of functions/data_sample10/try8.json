    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve an absolute (or global) maximum at a point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its domain. Conversely, we call a point x = c a relative (or local) maximum if, in some open interval around x = c, f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). Similarly, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c when f(x) is equal to or greater than f(c) across its entire domain. Additionally, a point x = c is identified as a relative (or local) minimum if, within some open interval surrounding x = c, f(x) maintains a value equal to or exceeding f(c).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in the context of a function \\( f(x) \\). The goal is to illustrate the differences between absolute and relative extrema, showcasing their locations on a graph of \\( f(x) \\). This visualization should clarify how absolute maxima and minima are determined over the entire domain of the function, whereas relative maxima and minima pertain to specific intervals. \n\nIn the visualization, include multiple graphs that depict a function with clear indicators for absolute maxima, absolute minima, relative maxima, and relative minima. Use different colors and labels to distinguish between these points effectively. Consider using an infographic style that combines graphical elements with informative annotations to help learners grasp the hierarchical relationships between global and local extrema. \n\nThis visual will deepen understanding by providing a concrete representation of how these concepts manifest in a function, enabling learners to see how maxima and minima interact in various contexts. \n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions, articulating the significance of each type in relation to the function's overall behavior.",
