    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points determines whether a function has local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the behavior of the first-order derivative test for identifying maxima and minima in a continuous function. The goal is to illustrate how the sign change of the first-order derivative \\( f' \\) at a critical point \\( c \\) indicates whether \\( f(c) \\) is a local maximum, a local minimum, or a point of inflection. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the slope of the function (represented by \\( f' \\)), the critical points, and the corresponding characteristics of the function in these regions.\n\nFor the visualization style, consider using a combination of a line graph illustrating the function \\( f(x) \\) alongside its first-order derivative \\( f'(x) \\). Accompany the graph with annotated markers to indicate critical points \\( c \\) and the transitions of \\( f' \\) from positive to negative or vice versa. This approach helps highlight the cause-effect relationships embedded in the first-order derivative test and provides clarity on how slope changes influence local extrema.\n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will achieve a deep understanding of how the first-order derivative functions as a diagnostic tool for determining the nature of critical points in functions, ultimately enhancing their ability to analyze and interpret critical and inflection points in calculus.",
