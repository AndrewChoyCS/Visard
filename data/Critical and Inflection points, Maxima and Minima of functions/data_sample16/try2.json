    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the first-order derivative's sign and its implications on the maxima, minima, and points of inflection of a continuous function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how the first-order derivative test determines local maxima and minima as well as points of inflection for a continuous function. The goal is to illustrate how changes in the sign of the first-order derivative (f'(x)) correlate with changes in the function\u2019s behavior at critical points (c). This visualization should clarify the conditions under which c is classified as a local maximum, local minimum, or point of inflection, emphasizing the transition of the derivative\u2019s sign. An appropriate style for this visualization could be a layered diagram that illustrates these relationships effectively, with clear annotations indicating the transitions between increasing and decreasing values of the function. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners should be able to visually understand how the first-order derivative affects a function's graph, identifying local maxima and minima, and recognizing points of inflection based on the derivative's behavior. By highlighting cause-effect relationships and sequential changes in the first-order derivative, the visualization will deepen students' insights into function analysis and its applications.",
