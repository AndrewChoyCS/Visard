    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points determines whether those points are local maxima, minima, or points of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points of a continuous function. The visualization should clearly illustrate how the slope of the function (represented by the first-order derivative) changes as it approaches a critical point. It should depict two scenarios: one where the derivative changes from positive to negative, indicating a local maximum, and another where it shifts from negative to positive, indicating a local minimum. Additionally, include a scenario where the derivative does not change, demonstrating a point of inflection.\n\nThe goal of the visualization is to clarify the relationship between the first-order derivative and the classification of critical points, emphasizing cause-effect relationships. An effective style could be a multi-part diagram or infographic that sequentially represents each scenario with labeled axes, arrows indicating slope changes, and distinct markings for maxima, minima, and inflection points. This approach will aid in deepening learners' understanding of how critical points relate to the behavior of the first-order derivative and the overall function.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to identify and classify critical points on a function based on the behavior of the first-order derivative, applying this understanding to ultimately analyze functions for maxima, minima, and inflection points.",
