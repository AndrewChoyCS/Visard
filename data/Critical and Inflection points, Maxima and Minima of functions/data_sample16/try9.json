    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points determines whether a function has a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the first-order derivative and the identification of maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a continuous function. The goal is to create a clear representation that illustrates how the slope (first-order derivative) changes at critical points where the derivative equals zero, categorizing these points as local maxima, minima, or points of inflection. \n\nThe visualization should incorporate a graph of a function with labeled critical points, highlighted sections that show changes in the sign of the first-order derivative, and annotations that indicate whether each point is a maximum, minimum, or inflection point. Using line graphs to depict the function's behavior in conjunction with a separate, simplified derivative graph will aid in clarifying these relationships.\n\nThis approach will enhance understanding by visually demonstrating the cause-and-effect relationship between the first-order derivative's behavior and the function's characteristics at critical points. By highlighting these transitions, learners will grasp key concepts more intuitively, supporting their ability to analyze and interpret functions effectively.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will deeply understand how the signs of the first-order derivative before and after critical points indicate the function's behavior, specifically in categorizing points as local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection, thereby enhancing their analytical skills in calculus.",
