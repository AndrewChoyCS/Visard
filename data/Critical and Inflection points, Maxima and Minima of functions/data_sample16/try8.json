    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the sign of the first-order derivative at critical points and the classification of these points as local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for identifying maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a function. The goal is to illustrate how changes in the sign of the first derivative (f') around critical points (where f' = 0) indicate whether the function is reaching a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither (inflection point). This visualization should depict a graph of a continuous function, highlighting key points where the derivative changes, with annotations indicating the classification of these points and the associated slopes. Consider using a combination of a line graph, annotated graphs, and color-coding to represent positive and negative slopes clearly. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will be able to identify critical points on a graph, understand the implications of the first-order derivative's sign changes, and classify these critical points accordingly. This visualization aims to enhance comprehension of cause-effect relationships in the context of calculus, helping students visualize how mathematical concepts function together. By presenting these elements sequentially, students will gain an intuitive grasp of the underlying relationships that define function behavior relative to its derivatives.",
