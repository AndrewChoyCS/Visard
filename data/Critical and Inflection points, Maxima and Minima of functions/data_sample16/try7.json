    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points determines whether those points are local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection.\n\n### Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the relationship between the first-order derivative and the identification of local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how changes in the sign of the first-order derivative correspond to the nature of critical points on a continuous function. This should clarify the concept that, when the derivative transitions from positive to negative, a local maximum is present, while a transition from negative to positive indicates a local minimum. Additionally, a lack of sign change should be depicted as a point of inflection. \n\nThe visualization should adopt a multi-graph format, incorporating a curve graph to show the function, along with derivative graphs to highlight changes in slope. Clear labels must denote maximum and minimum points, and visual cues (such as color changes) should emphasize the transitions in derivative signs. This approach helps learners visualize relationships and sequences, deepening their understanding of how derivatives characterize the behavior of functions.\n\n### Learning Objective:\nStudents will be able to accurately identify and classify critical points of a function by analyzing the behavior of its first-order derivative, enhancing their ability to apply calculus concepts in practical scenarios.",
