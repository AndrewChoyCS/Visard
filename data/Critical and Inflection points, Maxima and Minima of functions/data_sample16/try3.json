    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the first-order derivative and the identification of maximum and minimum points, including points of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the role of the first-order derivative in identifying maxima, minima, and points of inflection of a continuous function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the sign changes of the first-order derivative around a critical point (where f'(c) = 0) determine whether that point is a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection. The specific concept intended to be clarified is the cause-effect relationship between the slope of the function (illustrated by the first-order derivative) and the corresponding behaviors of the function graph near critical points.\n\nIncorporate a series of labeled graphs showing the function, its first-order derivative, and the corresponding sign changes at points c, highlighting the transitions from positive to negative and vice versa. An appropriate style for this visualization could be a series of interactive graphs or an infographic. This visual aids in understanding by clearly depicting the relationship and transitions in the slopes, reinforcing the concept of how derivatives inform function behavior.\n\n**Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of how the first-order derivative shapes the characteristics of a function, recognizing the significance of sign changes at critical points in identifying maxima, minima, and points of inflection.",
