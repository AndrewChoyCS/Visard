    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first-order derivative at critical points determines whether those points are local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the first-order derivative of a function and its critical points (local maxima, local minima, and points of inflection). The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the sign changes of the first-order derivative indicate the nature of these critical points. It should illustrate sequential transitions of the derivative's sign as the input values approach a critical point, effectively linking these transitions to the corresponding maximum and minimum values of the function. \n\nConsider using a multi-part diagram that features a graph of a function alongside its first-order derivative, highlighting regions where the derivative is positive, negative, or zero. This visual should clearly differentiate between local maxima, local minima, and points of inflection through color-coded sections and succinct labels. The intended educational outcome is for learners to understand how changes in the derivative signal different characteristics of the function and to visualize these relationships clearly, reinforcing the cause-effect connections inherent in the first-order derivative test.\n\n**Objective:** Develop a deep and crucial understanding of how the first-order derivative's behavior at critical points reflects the nature of local maxima and minima, enhancing learners' ability to analyze function behavior graphically.",
