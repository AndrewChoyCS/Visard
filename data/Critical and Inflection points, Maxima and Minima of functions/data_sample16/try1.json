    "data": "The first-order derivative test, as the term implies, employs the first-order derivative to locate maxima and minima. The first-order derivative provides the slope of the function. Suppose f is a continuous function at the critical point c within the open interval l where f'(c) equals zero; we will evaluate the curve's characteristics. There are specific scenarios to consider after assessing the curve's nature. As x approaches c, the following holds true: if the sign of f'(x) transitions from positive to negative, then f(c) designates the maximum value, and c represents the point of local maxima. Conversely, if the sign of f'(x) shifts from negative to positive, then f(c) indicates the minimum value, making c the point of local minima. If f'(x) does not change from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then c is classified as a point of inflection, meaning it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first-order derivative around critical points determines whether a function has a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how the first-order derivative test identifies local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a continuous function. The goal of this visualization is to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the sign changes of the first-order derivative (f') and the nature of the function (f) at critical points. It should illustrate the transitions from positive to negative and negative to positive slopes, marking clearly where the local maxima, minima, and points of inflection occur on the graph.\n\nThe visualization should incorporate multiple graphs of the same function showing different scenarios of f' around critical points (e.g., one that transitions from positive to negative, another from negative to positive, and one that remains constant). Using a combination of line graphs and annotated points, it should visually highlight the cause-and-effect relationships evident at these critical points. This clear representation will help students deeply understand how the behavior of the derivative reveals important characteristics of the function itself.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of how to analyze the first-order derivative to classify critical points of a function, providing a foundational comprehension of the relationships between slope behavior and function characteristics.",
