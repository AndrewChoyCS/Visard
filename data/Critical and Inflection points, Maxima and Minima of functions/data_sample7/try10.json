    "data": "The inflection point(s) of a function refer to the x-value(s) where the second derivative is either zero or does not exist, and the function demonstrates a change in concavity. A change in concavity occurs when the signs of the second derivative vary. In this case, points 1 and 2 were identified as inflection points because, at these x-values, the second derivative equals zero or is undefined, coupled with a change in the sign of the second derivative: \uf0b7 At point 1, the second derivative shifts from negative to positive, signifying that the concavity of the function transitions from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2, the second derivative changes from positive to negative, indicating that the function's concavity moves from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Despite the second derivative being undefined at another point, it does not represent an inflection point since there is no change in concavity\u2014the function remains concave up.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: Inflection Points and Change in Concavity**\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in a function and how they correspond to changes in concavity as indicated by the second derivative. The visualization should clearly demonstrate the x-values where the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined, and illustrate how, at these points, the concavity of the function transitions. Utilize a combination of graphs depicting the function and its second derivative, with labeled axes and highlighted areas indicating where changes in concavity occur. This visual structure should emphasize the relationship between the second derivative's sign changes and the function's concavity, allowing students to grasp the cause-effect relationship inherent to the concept of inflection points. \n\nThe intended educational outcome is for learners to confidently identify and interpret inflection points and understand their significance in evaluating the behavior of functions. By visualizing both the overall function and its second derivative, learners will deepen their comprehension of the interplay between derivative behavior and function characteristics, aligning with critical learning objectives related to maxima, minima, and concavity.",
