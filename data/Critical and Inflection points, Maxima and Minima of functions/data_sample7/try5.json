    "data": "The inflection point(s) of a function refer to the x-value(s) where the second derivative is either zero or does not exist, and the function demonstrates a change in concavity. A change in concavity occurs when the signs of the second derivative vary. In this case, points 1 and 2 were identified as inflection points because, at these x-values, the second derivative equals zero or is undefined, coupled with a change in the sign of the second derivative: \uf0b7 At point 1, the second derivative shifts from negative to positive, signifying that the concavity of the function transitions from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2, the second derivative changes from positive to negative, indicating that the function's concavity moves from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Despite the second derivative being undefined at another point, it does not represent an inflection point since there is no change in concavity\u2014the function remains concave up.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The identification of inflection points in a function, marked by changes in concavity as shown by the second derivative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points, specifically focusing on how the second derivative indicates changes in concavity. The visualization should illustrate a graph of a function showcasing two critical points where the second derivative is either zero or undefined, clearly marking these inflection points. Additionally, it should highlight the shifts in sign of the second derivative at these points\u2014point 1 where concavity changes from concave down to concave up, and point 2 where concavity shifts from concave up to concave down. Incorporating color coding and arrows to demonstrate the direction of concavity will enhance understanding. \n\nThe visualization should align with instructional design best practices by highlighting cause-and-effect relationships\u2014showing how the values of the second derivative impact the overall shape of the function. This will deepen the learner\u2019s insight into how inflection points affect the behavior of a function.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify and analyze inflection points on the graph of a function, understanding how changes in the second derivative inform about the concavity of the function, thus reinforcing the foundational concepts of critical points, maxima, and minima.",
