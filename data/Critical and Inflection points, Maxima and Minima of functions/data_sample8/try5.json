    "data": "The points of inflection for a function are the x-values where the second derivative equals zero or is undefined, and the function exhibits a change in concavity. A change in concavity can be observed if the second derivative alters its sign. The inflection points are termed as point A and point B because at these x-values, the second derivative is either zero or undefined and its sign flips: \uf0b7 At point A, the second derivative moves from negative to positive, thereby signaling a transition in concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point B, the second derivative transitions from positive to negative, indicating a change in concavity from concave up to concave down. While there is a point where the second derivative is undefined, it is not classified as an inflection point since the derivative does not exhibit a sign change and remains concave up throughout.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Points of inflection represent x-values where the second derivative changes sign, indicating a shift in concavity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of points of inflection on a function graph. The goal is to clearly illustrate the relationship between the second derivative and concavity changes, specifically showcasing how points A and B indicate transitions from concave down to concave up and vice versa. The visualization should include two distinct graphs: one showing the function itself with labeled inflection points and another graph representing the second derivative, highlighting its sign changes. An effective use of color can denote positive and negative regions of the second derivative, while arrows can illustrate the transitions at the inflection points. This visualization should aid learners in understanding the causal relationship between the second derivative's behavior and the concavity of the original function, fostering insight into critical points and maxima/minima as foundational concepts in calculus.\n\n**Objective:** By using this visualization, learners will deepen their understanding of how inflection points are identified through the second derivative's sign changes, enhancing their overall grasp of critical points and functions' concavity descriptions.",
