    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is projected vertically upwards. The height \\( h \\) of the object at any time \\( t \\) is represented by the function: \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\). To determine the peak height of this projectile, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the height function: \n\n\\( h' = 0 + 10 - 3(2t) = 10 - 6t \\). \n\nNext, let\u2019s find when the slope equals zero: \n\n\\( 10 - 6t = 0 \\) leads to \n\n\\( 6t = 10 \\) implying \n\n\\( t = \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.67 \\) seconds. \n\nAt this time \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds, we can calculate the height:\n\n\\( h = 2 + 10 \\times 1.67 - 3 \\times (1.67)^2 \\) results in \n\n\\( h = 2 + 16.7 - 8.33 = 10.37 \\). \n\nThus, the maximum height achieved by the object is approximately 10.37 meters at \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between time, height, and the derivatives of the height function in determining the maximum height of a projectile.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the dynamics of a projectile's height over time, focusing on the function \\( h(t) = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\) and its derivative \\( h'(t) = 10 - 6t \\). The visualization should clearly depict how the height of the object changes with time, highlighting the critical point where the slope of the height function equals zero, indicating the maximum height. Use a graph that plots both the height function and its derivative, marking the point \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds where the maximum height of approximately 10.37 meters occurs. \n\nThis visualization should aid in understanding the cause-effect relationship between the derivative and the function itself, illustrating how changes in time impact height and how this ties into critical points and maxima in calculus. Including annotations or color coding to emphasize these relationships will enhance accessibility and engage learners more effectively.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\n- Learners will gain a clear understanding of how the derivative informs the behavior of the height function.\n- Students will be able to identify critical points and compare the steepness of the slope at different times.\n- The visualization will support an intuitive grasp of maxima and minima concepts as they relate to physical motion.",
