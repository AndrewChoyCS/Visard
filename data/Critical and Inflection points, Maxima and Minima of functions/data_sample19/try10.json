    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is projected vertically upwards. The height \\( h \\) of the object at any time \\( t \\) is represented by the function: \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\). To determine the peak height of this projectile, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the height function: \n\n\\( h' = 0 + 10 - 3(2t) = 10 - 6t \\). \n\nNext, let\u2019s find when the slope equals zero: \n\n\\( 10 - 6t = 0 \\) leads to \n\n\\( 6t = 10 \\) implying \n\n\\( t = \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.67 \\) seconds. \n\nAt this time \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds, we can calculate the height:\n\n\\( h = 2 + 10 \\times 1.67 - 3 \\times (1.67)^2 \\) results in \n\n\\( h = 2 + 16.7 - 8.33 = 10.37 \\). \n\nThus, the maximum height achieved by the object is approximately 10.37 meters at \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: Understanding Maxima and Minima in a Quadratic Function through Derivatives**\n\n**Query: Create a visualization to explain the concept of determining peak height using derivatives in the context of a vertically projected object.** The visualization should illustrate the height function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\) as a parabola, highlighting the critical point where the slope (derivative) of the height function is zero. Include a clear graph showing the height over time, marking the peak point at \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds and the maximum height of approximately 10.37 meters. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the derivative (slope) and the maximum height achieved by the projectile. By using a combination of a line graph for the height function and a tangent line at the critical point to represent the slope, the visualization will enhance understanding of how to determine maxima in quadratic functions. This approach supports key educational outcomes related to identifying critical points, understanding the significance of derivatives, and applying calculus concepts to real-world scenarios. \n\nThis visual will aid in illustrating cause-effect relationships, showcasing how changes in time impact height, and deepening students' understanding of the principles of maxima and minima in functions.",
