    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe determination of maximum height in a projectile motion context using calculus, specifically through the use of derivatives to find critical points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain how the maximum height of a projectile can be determined using the height function derived from the equations of motion. The visualization should include a graph of the height function \\( h(t) = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\) with a focus on identifying critical points and the behavior of the derivative \\( h' \\). The goal is to clarify how the slope of the height function changes over time and how these changes correspond to the object's vertical motion, ultimately leading to the peak height.\n\nThe visualization should employ a clear line graph to represent the height versus time, marking the critical point where the derivative equals zero. Additionally, it could include a secondary graph that illustrates the derivative \\( h' \\) over the same interval to emphasize the relationship between the slope and the object's motion. By illustrating these connections, the learners can better understand the cause-effect relationship between the height function and its derivative, reinforcing their knowledge of maxima and minima in calculus.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\n1. Students will comprehend how to mathematically identify maxima in polynomial functions through calculus.\n2. Learners will visualize the relationship between the height of a projectile and its rate of change over time, enhancing their understanding of motion dynamics.\n3. The visualization will support the deeper understanding of critical points as they relate to real-world scenarios, making the mathematical concepts more tangible and relatable.",
