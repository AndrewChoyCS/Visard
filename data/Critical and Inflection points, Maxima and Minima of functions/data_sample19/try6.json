    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The determination of maximum height of a projectile through the analysis of the height function and its derivative.\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile based on its height function. The goal is to illustrate how the height \\( h \\) of an object varies over time \\( t \\) using the function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\), and how the derivative \\( h' = 10 - 6t \\) helps identify the critical point where the maximum height is reached. \n\nThis visualization should include a graph that displays both the original height function and its derivative, marking the point where the slope (derivative) equals zero and indicating the corresponding maximum height. Employ styles such as line graphs or area plots to represent changes over time clearly. The visualization should distinctly highlight the relationship between time, height, and the concept of maxima, thereby helping learners understand the process of analyzing functions to determine critical points effectively.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nStudents will grasp how to analyze functions to find critical points and maxima, enhancing their understanding of calculus concepts such as derivatives and optimization in real-world scenarios.",
