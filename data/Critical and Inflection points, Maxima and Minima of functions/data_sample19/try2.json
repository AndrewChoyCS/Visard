    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile by analyzing the height function and its derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height of a vertically projected object using the height function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\). The goal is to clarify how derivatives help identify critical points where the maximum height occurs, focusing particularly on the relationship between time \\( t \\), height \\( h \\), and the derivative \\( h' \\). It should include a graph of the height function over time, clearly marking the point where the slope \\( h' = 0 \\) and highlighting the peak height achieved at that specific time. \n\nTo enhance understanding, consider utilizing a combination of a line graph for the height function, an overlay indicating the derivative, and annotations that guide learners through the critical points in the calculation. This visual will facilitate a deeper understanding of how the relationship between the function and its derivative informs the object's motion and emphasizes the significance of maxima and minima in real-world applications. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to articulate the process of finding the maximum height of a projectile by effectively analyzing mathematical functions and their derivatives, enhancing their proficiency in identifying critical points and understanding the behavior of quadratic functions in applied contexts.",
