    "goal": "**Core Principle: Maximum Height and Derivatives in Vertical Motion**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the height of a projected object and its time of flight, particularly focusing on how to determine the maximum height using derivatives. The goal is to visually represent the parabolic nature of the height function \\( h(t) = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\), highlighting the point at which the derivative (slope) equals zero, indicating the peak height. \n\nThis visualization should include a graph of the height function with labeled axes for time \\( t \\) (x-axis) and height \\( h \\) (y-axis), a distinct curve illustrating the parabolic trajectory, and markers indicating the critical point where \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds corresponds with the maximum height of approximately 10.37 meters. To clarify the concept of derivatives, the graph should also include a tangent line at the peak height to visually represent the slope of zero at that point.\n\nKey educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deep understanding of how to find maxima in parabolic functions, the role of derivatives in identifying critical points, and the real-world implications of vertical motion under gravity. By illustrating the relationships between height, time, and slope, the learner will enhance their comprehension of how mathematical concepts apply to physical phenomena. \n\nThis approach aligns with best practices in instructional design, as it emphasizes cause-effect relationships (the impact of time on height), sequential processes (time increasing leading to height increase until the maximum), and comparative analysis (height at critical points versus other times), thereby enriching the learner\u2019s insight into the dynamics of projectile motion.",
