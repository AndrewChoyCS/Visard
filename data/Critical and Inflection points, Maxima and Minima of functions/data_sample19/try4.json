    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is projected vertically upwards. The height \\( h \\) of the object at any time \\( t \\) is represented by the function: \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\).

    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between time and height in projectile motion, specifically focusing on finding the maximum height using derivatives.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the dynamics of a vertically projected object's height over time, illustrating how to determine the maximum height. The aim is to clarify the function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\), the derivative \\( h' = 10 - 6t \\), and the process of finding the point where the slope equals zero. The visualization should incorporate a graph that plots height against time, clearly marking key points, including the maximum height at \\( t \\approx 1.67 \\) seconds and \\( h \\approx 10.37 \\) meters. Additionally, including a shaded area to visually represent the effect of time on height could enhance understanding of the relationship. \n\nThe visual should adopt a clear line graph style, with labeled axes (time on the x-axis and height on the y-axis) and annotations for the critical points where the slope is zero and the corresponding maximum height. This approach will help students comprehend the process of identifying maxima and minima through graphical analysis, reinforcing their understanding of critical points in calculus. \n\n**Educational Outcome**: By engaging with this visualization, students will achieve a deep understanding of how the relationship between time and height in projectile motion is represented mathematically and graphically, enhancing their ability to identify maxima through both derivatives and graphical interpretation.",
