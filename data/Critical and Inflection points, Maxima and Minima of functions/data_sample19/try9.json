    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile through derivative analysis, specifically identifying critical points where the slope of the height function equals zero.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height reached by a projectile using its height function and derivatives. The goal of the visualization is to clarify the relationship between the function representing height over time, the derivative of that function (which gives the slope), and the key inflection point where the slope equals zero, indicating the peak height. \n\nThe visualization should include a graph of the height function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\), clearly labeled axes for time \\( t \\) (x-axis) and height \\( h \\) (y-axis), along with a visual marker highlighting the critical point at \\( t = 1.67 \\) seconds. Additionally, include a tangent line at this point to illustrate where the slope transitions from positive to negative and indicate that this corresponds to the maximum height of approximately 10.37 meters.\n\nUsing a line graph style will effectively convey this sequential process, providing learners with a clear visual representation of how the relationships within the function evolve over time. The visualization should deepen learners' understanding of how critical points in calculus are applied in real-world scenarios like projectile motion.\n\n**Educational Objectives:**\n1. Students will accurately identify and analyze critical points in functions using derivatives.\n2. Learners will understand the relationship between a function\u2019s behavior and its derivatives, reinforcing core concepts of maxima and minima in calculus.",
