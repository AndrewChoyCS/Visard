    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The determination of the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives to identify critical points.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain how to find the maximum height of a vertically projected object using the function \\( h = 2 + 10t - 3t^2 \\). The goal is to illustrate the relationship between time \\( t \\), height \\( h \\), and the slope of the height function. This visualization should include a graph that displays the height function, highlighting the calculated critical point where the slope equals zero to indicate the peak height. Additionally, a diagram could show the derivative \\( h' \\) and how it changes over time until reaching zero. \n\nBy visualizing both the trajectory of the height and the derivative\u2019s slope, learners will grasp the cause-effect relationship of how derivatives are used to find maxima and minima in functions. The expected educational outcomes include a deeper comprehension of critical points in calculus and the application of derivatives in real-world scenarios, fostering the ability to analyze and interpret polynomial functions effectively.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of the session, learners should be able to accurately determine critical points using derivatives and understand their implications in finding maximum or minimum values of polynomial functions, thereby enhancing their problem-solving skills in calculus.",
