    "data": "The inflection point(s) of a function is the x-value(s) at which the second derivative is zero or undefined and the function is changing concavity. You can tell that the function changes concavity if the second derivative changes signs. The inflection points are point 1 and point 2 because the second derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and the sign of the second derivative changes signs: \uf0b7 At point 1 the second derivative changes signs from negative to positive, which means the function changes concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2 the second derivative changes signs from positive to negative, which means the function changes concavity from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Although the second derivative is undefined at , it is not an inflection point because the second derivative does not change signs, it remains concave up.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of inflection points is characterized by changes in concavity and sign changes in the second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in a function. The visualization should clearly illustrate the relationship between the second derivative, its sign changes, and the corresponding changes in concavity of the original function. The goal is to highlight how inflection points occur where the second derivative is either zero or undefined, while also showcasing the specific sign changes that indicate a switch from concave down to concave up and vice versa.\n\nThe visualization should use a combination of line graphs depicting the original function and its second derivative, along with annotated markers for inflection points (point 1 and point 2). Include clear labels indicating the nature of concavity (concave up and down) and arrows to demonstrate sign changes. An infographic style could be effective, as it allows for both clarity and creativity in presenting the information. \n\nThis visual will help students understand not only where inflection points lie but also why they occur, enhancing their grasp of the concept and its application in calculus. \n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify inflection points on a graph, explain the significance of second derivative sign changes, and illustrate the relationship between a function's concavity and its second derivative, deepening their understanding of maximas, minimas, and overall function behavior.",
