You can tell that the function changes concavity if the second derivative changes signs. The inflection points are point 1 and point 2 because the second derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and the sign of the second derivative changes signs: \uf0b7 At point 1 the second derivative changes signs from negative to positive, which means the function changes concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2 the second derivative changes signs from positive to negative, which means the function changes concavity from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Although the second derivative is undefined at , it is not an inflection point because the second derivative does not change signs, it remains concave up.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\n**Inflection Points and Changes in Concavity: The relationship between the second derivative of a function and its concavity changes, specifically illustrating where the second derivative is zero or undefined.**\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in the context of a function's concavity change.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the second derivative indicates concavity by highlighting the x-values where the second derivative is zero or undefined. It should explicitly show the transitions between concave up and concave down behavior at two designated inflection points. \n\nConsider using a multi-part diagram that includes:\n1. A graph of a function displaying concave up and down sections, clearly marked with the inflection points (Point 1 and Point 2).\n2. An overlay of the second derivative with distinct sections labeled according to whether it is positive, negative, or undefined.\n3. Annotations that emphasize the changes in signs of the second derivative at the inflection points. \n\nThis visualization will aid in understanding cause-effect relationships by connecting how the second derivative's signs affect concavity and illustrating that the undefined point does not result in a change in concavity.\n\n### Learning Objective\nStudents will be able to identify and analyze inflection points within a function by understanding the interplay between the second derivative's values and the function's concavity, thereby deepening their comprehension of critical points in calculus.",
