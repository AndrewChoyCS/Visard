    "data": "The inflection point(s) of a function is the x-value(s) at which the second derivative is zero or undefined and the function is changing concavity. You can tell that the function changes concavity if the second derivative changes signs. The inflection points are point 1 and point 2 because the second derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and the sign of the second derivative changes signs: \uf0b7 At point 1 the second derivative changes signs from negative to positive, which means the function changes concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2 the second derivative changes signs from positive to negative, which means the function changes concavity from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Although the second derivative is undefined at , it is not an inflection point because the second derivative does not change signs, it remains concave up.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The identification of inflection points in a function based on the behavior of the second derivative, including when it is zero, undefined, and changes signs.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in a function, emphasizing how the second derivative behaves at these critical x-values. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between the second derivative's sign changes and the function's concavity shifts. This visualization should include two distinct graphs: one showing the second derivative crossing zero (indicating inflection points) and changing signs, and another showcasing how the original function's concavity transitions from concave up to concave down and vice versa.\n\n**Visualization Style Suggestions:** A dual graph setup should be used, with clear labeling of the axes and the inflection points highlighted. Consider integrating color coding to represent concave up (e.g., green) and concave down (e.g., red) regions of the graph. Arrows or annotations can indicate the change of signs of the second derivative.\n\n**Educational Outcome:** This visualization should enable learners to deeply understand how inflection points are determined through the interplay between the second derivative and concavity of the function. It is intended to clarify the causal relationships between sign changes in the second derivative and the resulting changes in concavity, fostering a comprehensive grasp of critical concepts in calculus related to maxima and minima.",
