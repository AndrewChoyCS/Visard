    "data": "The inflection point(s) of a function is the x-value(s) at which the second derivative is zero or undefined and the function is changing concavity. You can tell that the function changes concavity if the second derivative changes signs. The inflection points are point 1 and point 2 because the second derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and the sign of the second derivative changes signs: \uf0b7 At point 1 the second derivative changes signs from negative to positive, which means the function changes concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2 the second derivative changes signs from positive to negative, which means the function changes concavity from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Although the second derivative is undefined at , it is not an inflection point because the second derivative does not change signs, it remains concave up.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The concept of inflection points where the second derivative changes signs, indicating a change in concavity of the function. \n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the second derivative determines the concavity of a function and how its sign changes at inflection points, specifically highlighting points 1 and 2. The visual should clarify the relationship between the second derivative, its values, and the concavity of the function, using a combination of graphs that show the original function, its first derivative, and its second derivative. \n\nConsider using a multi-layered graph style with clearly labeled axes, key points marked with annotations, and color-coding to differentiate between concave up and concave down segments. This visual will aid in understanding by showing cause-effect relationships\u2014how changes in the second derivative lead to shifts in concavity. By including a note about the point where the second derivative is undefined but does not represent an inflection point, learners will gain a nuanced understanding. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and characterize inflection points in functions by analyzing the behavior of the second derivative, thereby developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between derivatives and concavity within the context of calculus.",
