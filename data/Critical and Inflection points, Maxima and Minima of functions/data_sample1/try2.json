You can tell that the function changes concavity if the second derivative changes signs. The inflection points are point 1 and point 2 because the second derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and the sign of the second derivative changes signs: \uf0b7 At point 1 the second derivative changes signs from negative to positive, which means the function changes concavity from concave down to concave up. \uf0b7 At point 2 the second derivative changes signs from positive to negative, which means the function changes concavity from concave up to concave down. \uf0b7 Although the second derivative is undefined at , it is not an inflection point because the second derivative does not change signs, it remains concave up.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\n**Inflection Points and Changes in Concavity**: Inflection points occur at x-values where the second derivative is zero or undefined, and they signify a change in concavity of the function. This can be observed when the sign of the second derivative shifts from positive to negative or vice versa.\n\n### Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points and changes in concavity in a function. The visualization should depict a graph showing a function with identifiable inflection points labeled as point 1 and point 2, highlighting where the second derivative equals zero or is undefined. The visualization should include annotations that clearly indicate the changes in the concavity of the function\u2014from concave down to concave up at point 1 and from concave up to concave down at point 2. Use contrasting colors to represent the different concavities and arrow indicators for the sign changes of the second derivative.\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to enhance understanding of how inflection points are identified through the behavior of the second derivative and its signs. By illustrating these relationships in a clear and engaging manner, learners will deepen their insight into the critical concepts of maxima, minima, and concavity changes, ultimately fostering a more robust comprehension of calculus principles.\n\n### Objective\nStudents will be able to identify and analyze inflection points in functions by interpreting the behavior of the second derivative, thereby gaining a fundamental understanding of concavity and its implications in calculus. This mastery will enable them to apply these concepts in future analyses of function behavior and optimization.",
