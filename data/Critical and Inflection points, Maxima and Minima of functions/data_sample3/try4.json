Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted: The Role of the First Order Derivative in Identifying Maxima, Minima, and Points of Inflection**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the first order derivative of a function and its critical points, specifically focusing on how these points indicate maxima, minima, and points of inflection. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how changes in the sign of the first derivative (f'(x)) correlate with the nature of the critical point (local maxima, minima, or points of inflection). The expected educational outcomes include a clearer understanding of how to determine maximum and minimum values of a function and the significance of the first order derivative in identifying these points. \n\nThe visualization should include multiple graphs that demonstrate the function, its first derivative, and the specific points where f'(x) = 0. A line graph style could be effective, displaying the function curve alongside a derivative graph with markers indicating where the sign changes occur. Additionally, the inclusion of annotations or color-coding to indicate the nature of the points (local maxima, minima, or inflection) will enhance recognition and retention of these critical concepts.\n\n### Educational Objective:\nStudents will develop a deep understanding of how the first order derivative tests function behavior and critically analyze the relationship between derivative signs and the identification of maxima, minima, and points of inflection. This understanding will enable students to make informed decisions about function behavior based on derivative analysis, improving their mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills in calculus.",
