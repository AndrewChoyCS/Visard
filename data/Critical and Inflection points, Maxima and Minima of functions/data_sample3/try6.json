    "data": "The first order derivative test as the name suggests it uses first order derivative to find maxima and minima. The first order derivative gives the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The behavior of a function's first derivative at critical points indicates whether the function has a local maximum, local minimum, or an inflection point.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first order derivative test for identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points of functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the sign changes of the first derivative (f') around a critical point (c) correspond to different characteristics of the function (maxima, minima, or inflection). This will clarify the relationships between the derivative's behavior and the nature of the function's curve. \n\nI suggest using a combination of line graphs to represent the function and its first derivative, along with labeled annotations that indicate where f'(c) = 0 and the transitions between positive and negative slopes occur. Highlighting the regions around critical point c where the sign of f' changes will help learners understand the sequential relationship between the derivative and the function, leading to a deeper comprehension of the critical points. \n\n**Educational Outcomes Expected:** Students should be able to identify critical points, interpret the behavior of the first derivative, and assertively classify the nature of these critical points based on the sign changes of f'. \n\n**Objective:** Deepen students' understanding of how the first derivative informs the nature of a function's extremes and inflection points, emphasizing the importance of derivative sign changes in calculus.",
