Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe relationship between the first order derivative of a function and the identification of local maxima, minima, and points of inflection based on the sign changes of the derivative.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the First Order Derivative Test for identifying local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in continuous functions. The goal is to clearly illustrate how the slope of a function (represented by its first derivative) changes as you approach a critical point, highlighting the transitions in sign (positive or negative) that determine the nature of that critical point. The visualization should include a line graph of a function with its derivative graph displayed above or below, indicating critical points and their corresponding classifications (maxima, minima, inflection points) through clearly labeled annotations.\n\nIncorporate color coding for each category (e.g., red for maxima, green for minima, blue for points of inflection) to aid in immediate recognition. This visualization will deepen learners\u2019 understanding of the cause-effect relationships between the first derivative and the function's behavior, fostering a more intuitive grasp of how mathematical analysis informs function characteristics.\n\n**Educational Outcomes Objective:**\nBy the end of the lesson, students should be able to visually interpret and analyze the behavior of functions using the first order derivative, accurately identifying critical points and classifying them as local maxima, minima, or points of inflection, reinforcing their comprehension of the dynamics between derivative slopes and function behavior.",
