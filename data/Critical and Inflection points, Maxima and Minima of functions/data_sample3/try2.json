    "data": "The first order derivative test as the name suggests it uses first order derivative to find maxima and minima. The first order derivative gives the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the first derivative of a function and the identification of critical points, local maxima, local minima, and inflection points.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the First Order Derivative Test in determining local maxima, minima, and points of inflection for a continuous function. The goal of this visualization is to enhance learners' understanding of how changes in the sign of the first derivative relate to the nature of critical points. By illustrating a graph of a function alongside its derivative, we can clearly depict how the slope transitions and indicates maxima, minima, and inflection points. \n\nThe visualization should take the form of an infographic that combines a function curve with its first derivative, featuring clear labels and color coding to differentiate between regions of increase, decrease, maxima, minima, and inflection points. This will help students visualize the cause-effect relationship between the function's curves and the behavior of its derivative, deepening their insight into how to analyze function behavior through its derivative.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will develop a comprehensive understanding of the First Order Derivative Test, enabling them to effectively identify critical points, recognize the characteristics of local maxima and minima, and understand the implications of points of inflection in the context of a function's behavior.",
