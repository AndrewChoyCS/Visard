Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Behavior of the First Derivative at Critical Points Determines Local Maxima, Minima, and Points of Inflection.**\n\n**Query: Create a visualization to explain the first order derivative test and its role in identifying local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.** The goal of this visualization is to clearly depict how the sign changes of the first derivative (f') around a critical point (c) indicate the nature of the function's behavior\u2014whether it is reaching a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection. \n\nThis visualization should include a graph of a typical continuous function with labeled axes, highlighting critical point c where f'(c) = 0. Using color-coded arrows, the graph should illustrate the transitions of f'(x) from positive to negative (for maxima) and from negative to positive (for minima), as well as areas where the derivative does not change sign (for inflection points). A supplementary infographic or diagram can accompany the graph to succinctly explain each case with concise notes.\n\nBy focusing on the relationships between critical points, sign changes in the first derivative, and the corresponding nature of the function (maxima, minima, or inflection), the visual aids can greatly enhance understanding. This will help learners build a solid conceptual foundation in analyzing functions' behaviors. \n\n**Objective:** Students will deeply understand how the first order derivative test is applied to determine local maxima, minima, and points of inflection by engaging with a structured visualization that clearly illustrates the relationships and sequences of behavior concerning critical points in a function's graph.",
