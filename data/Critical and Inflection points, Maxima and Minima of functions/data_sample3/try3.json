    "data": "The first order derivative test as the name suggests it uses first order derivative to find maxima and minima. The first order derivative gives the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first derivative in relation to critical points of a function to determine local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between the first derivative of a function and its critical points. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how changes in the sign of the first derivative inform us about the nature of critical points\u2014specifically identifying local maxima, local minima, and points of inflection. This visual representation should use a series of graphs displaying a continuous function with its first derivative, where key points (critical points and inflection points) are highlighted.\n\nThe visualization could employ a combination of line graphs and annotated curves, emphasizing the signs of the first derivative before and after the critical points. Arrows could indicate direction of change, and annotations can explain the implications of each sign change. This approach aids in understanding the cause-effect relationship of critical points and their identification through the first derivative.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will develop a deep understanding of the first derivative test, enabling them to effectively identify local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in continuous functions through visual analysis of sign changes in the first derivative.",
