Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The relationship between the first derivative of a function and its critical points, which determines local maxima, minima, and inflection points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the First Order Derivative Test for identifying critical points in a function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the sign changes of the first derivative (f'(x)) at critical points (c) indicate whether these points are local maxima, minima, or inflection points. It should clarify the sequential relationship between the slope of the function and changing signs of the derivative as x approaches c. \n\nTo effectively convey this principle, consider using multiple graphs overlaid on a single coordinate system, highlighting the function's curve along with its first derivative. Use color coding to represent positive and negative slopes, clearly indicating points where the sign changes and labeling local maxima, minima, and inflection points. Incorporate annotations summarizing the results of the first order derivative test at each critical point. \n\nThis visual framework aids in deepening understanding by clearly illustrating causal relationships between the derivative and the nature of the function, allowing learners to visualize dynamic changes and their implications on graph behavior. The objective is to facilitate a robust understanding of how to analyze critical points through the lens of derivative behavior, honing learners' ability to apply these concepts in various mathematical contexts.",
