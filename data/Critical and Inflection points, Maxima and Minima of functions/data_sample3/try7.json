    "data": "The first order derivative test as the name suggests it uses first order derivative to find maxima and minima. The first order derivative gives the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The behavior of the first derivative at critical points determines whether those points are local maxima, minima, or points of inflection.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the first order derivative test and its role in identifying local maxima, minima, and points of inflection. The visualization should feature a graph of a continuous function that includes critical points where the first derivative equals zero. It should clearly indicate areas where the derivative changes signs\u2014demonstrating transitions from positive to negative (local maxima) and from negative to positive (local minima). A section should also illustrate the point of inflection, where the derivative does not change sign.\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify how the behavior of the first derivative reveals the nature of critical points on the function. This will allow learners to see relationships between the function, its derivative, and the types of critical points. Utilize a combination of line graphs (for the function and its derivative) and labeled regions to enhance comprehension. This multi-faceted visual approach helps deepen understanding by providing clear cause-effect relationships and highlighting the sequential process involved in applying the first order derivative test.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo enable students to effectively determine the nature of critical points in continuous functions through the first order derivative test, reinforcing their understanding of how derivative sign changes directly indicate local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.",
