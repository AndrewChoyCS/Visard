    "data": "The first order derivative test as the name suggests it uses first order derivative to find maxima and minima. The first order derivative gives the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function at critical point c on the open interval l such that f'(c) = 0 then, we will check the nature of the curve. Below are some conditions after checking the nature of the curve, and x increases towards c i.e., the critical point. If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, then f(c) is the maximum value and c is the point of local maxima. If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, then f(c) is the minimum value and c is the point of local minima. If the sign of f'(x) neither changes from positive to negative nor from negative to positive, then c is called the point of inflection i.e., neither maxima nor minima.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of a function's first derivative at critical points determines local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between a function's first derivative and its critical points, particularly focusing on local maxima, minima, and points of inflection. The goal is to illustrate how the sign of the first derivative changes as one approaches these critical points and what that implies for the function's behavior. This visualization should clarify the importance of understanding the slope of the function and how it relates to the concepts of maxima and minima.\n\n**Visualization Style:** Use a combination of line graphs and annotated diagrams. The line graphs should display a generic continuous function alongside its first derivative, highlighting the critical points where the derivative is zero. Use color coding to indicate where the first derivative changes from positive to negative (maxima) and from negative to positive (minima). Additionally, use dashed lines or markers to denote points of inflection where the derivative does not change sign.\n\n**How the Visual Aids Understanding:** This visual will deepen understanding by clearly showing the direct relationship between the slope (first derivative) and the nature of the function at critical points. By sequentially presenting these changes in a structured way, learners can easily grasp how the first derivative informs the identification of maxima, minima, and points of inflection, reinforcing their comprehension of the concept.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to analyze and interpret the behavior of a function based on its first derivative, enabling them to accurately identify local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in various functions.",
