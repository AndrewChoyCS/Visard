    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile using the derivative of its height function, highlighting the relationship between the function, its derivative, and critical points.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of finding the maximum height of a projectile. The visualization should illustrate the quadratic function representing the height of the ball over time, with key annotations marking the critical point where the derivative is zero, indicating the maximum height. This visual should also include a graph of the derivative function, clearly showing how the slope changes. The goal is to clarify not only the relationships between the function and its derivative but also the significance of critical points in determining maxima and minima. \n\nThe preferred style is a combined infographic and graph overlay, which will visually engage learners by connecting the mathematical concepts of derivatives and critical points directly to the behavior of the height function. By highlighting these relationships, the visualization will deepen understanding of how changes in the input variable (time) directly impact the output (height), leading to a stronger grasp of the underlying mathematical principles.\n\n**Objective:** To foster a deep understanding of how derivatives are used to identify critical points in a quadratic function and their implications in real-world applications, such as projectile motion, enabling learners to apply these concepts in various mathematical contexts.",
