    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Understanding how to find the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives to identify critical points and analyze the behavior of a quadratic function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of finding the maximum height of a projectile described by a quadratic function. The visualization should include a graph of the function \\( h = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\) with labeled axes for time (t) and height (h), highlighting the curve's peak at the maximum height. Additionally, plot the derivative \\( h' = 14 - 10t \\) on the same graph to show how the slope becomes zero at the critical point \\( t = 1.4 \\) seconds. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationships between height, time, and slope, particularly how the slope's change reflects the motion of the projectile. Visualizing these elements helps learners grasp the concept of critical points, inflection points, and how they relate to finding maxima and minima of functions. This could be effectively presented as an infographic that combines the graphs with annotations explaining each step in the process, enhancing the understanding of the derivative and its significance in optimization problems.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nStudents will develop a deep and crucial understanding of how to determine maximum and minimum values of functions through the analysis of derivatives,, identify critical points, and visualize the relationship between the function and its derivative, thereby solidifying their grasp of calculus concepts in practical applications.",
