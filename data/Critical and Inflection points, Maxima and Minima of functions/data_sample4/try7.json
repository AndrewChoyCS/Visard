    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe relationship between the function of height over time, its derivative, and the calculation of maximum height through critical points.\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of finding the maximum height of a parabolic function using derivatives. The goal is to illustrate how the height of an object thrown in the air changes over time, emphasizing the point at which the slope of the height function becomes zero (indicative of maximum height). This visualization should highlight the relationships between the original height function \\( h(t) = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\), its derivative \\( h'(t) = 14 - 10t \\), and the corresponding values of \\( t \\) at critical points, particularly at \\( t = 1.4 \\) seconds.\n\n### Suggested Visualization Style:\nAn infographic or multi-layered graph would be highly effective, displaying the quadratic function alongside its tangent line for slope representation. Use a clear coordinate grid where the height function is plotted, labeling key points such as the vertex (maximum height) and identifying where the derivative equals zero. \n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nViewers should be able to grasp how to find maximum or minimum points on a graph using the first derivative, recognize the significance of critical points in relation to a physical scenario (like a thrown ball), and understand the transition between the function's graphical representation and its mathematical formulation. This visual aids in deepening comprehension by clearly mapping out the sequences involved in calculating maxima and minima, thus highlighting the cause-effect relationship between the function\u2019s behavior and its derivatives. \n\n### Objective:\nThe objective is to enable learners to effectively analyze functions to determine critical points via derivatives, fostering a conceptual understanding of how changes in a function correlate to real-world scenarios, thus enhancing their mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills.",
