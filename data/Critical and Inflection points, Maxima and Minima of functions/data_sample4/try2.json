    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the time of a projectile's flight, its height, and how to determine the maximum height using derivatives to find critical points (where the slope equals zero).\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between time, height, and maximum height of a projectile \u2014 specifically focusing on how to identify critical points using derivatives. The visualization should illustrate a quadratic curve representing the height equation \\( h = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\), highlighting the maximum point at \\( t = 1.4 \\) seconds. Include an annotated line showing the slope of the function at various points, particularly where the slope is zero (indicating the maximum height). Suggested styles could include a dynamic graph that illustrates the shape of the parabola and the tangent line, as well as labeled annotations for key points.\n\nThis visual will clarify how the derivative relates to the function's behavior and deepen understanding of maxima and minima through the observation of slope changes. The learning objective is to foster a robust comprehension of how to apply calculus concepts\u2014specifically derivatives\u2014to real-world scenarios, enhancing learners' abilities to identify maximum points in different situations.",
