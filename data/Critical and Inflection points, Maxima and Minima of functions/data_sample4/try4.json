    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the derivative of a function and how it determines the maximum height of a projectile.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain how derivatives help determine the maximum height of a projectile, exemplified by the equation h = 3 + 14t \u2212 5t\u00b2. The visualization should depict the function graphically, marking the height trajectory of the ball over time, while also illustrating the derivative (slope) of the function. The goal is to clarify how the slope changes and when it reaches zero, indicating the maximum height. \n\nThis visualization can take the form of an interactive graph showing the height (h) on the y-axis and time (t) on the x-axis, with annotations for key points like the slope at various intervals and the inflection point at t = 1.4 seconds. The visual should guide the learner in understanding the relationship between the original function and its derivative, reinforcing the concept of how critical points can be identified and interpreted in the context of motion, ultimately leading to a deeper comprehension of maxima and minima.\n\n**Expected Educational Outcomes:** \n- Learners should be able to identify critical and inflection points on the graph.\n- Students will gain an understanding of how the derivative informs the behavior of a function and its maxima.\n- This visualization should enhance comprehension of the cause-effect relationship between time, height, and slope in projectile motion, reinforcing foundational principles in calculus.",
