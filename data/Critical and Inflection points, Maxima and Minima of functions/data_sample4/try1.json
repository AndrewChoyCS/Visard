    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted\nThe relationship between the height of a projectile over time, the use of derivatives to find maxima, and the identification of critical points in a quadratic function.\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives. The goal is to visually represent how the height of the ball changes over time using a quadratic graph, indicating the critical point where the slope (derivative) is zero. This visualization should illustrate the relationship between the height function \\( h(t) = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\) and its derivative \\( h'(t) = 14 - 10t \\). By displaying the quadratic curve alongside a tangent line at the critical point, learners can see how the slope transitions from positive to negative, marking the maximum height at \\( t = 1.4 \\) seconds and \\( h = 12.8 \\) m.\n\n### Suggested Visualization Styles\nAn infographic or dynamic graph could effectively depict this relationship by showing key values (like the maximum height) directly on the curve. Additionally, an interactive tool could allow learners to manipulate the time variable \\( t \\) to see how height changes and observe when the slope becomes zero.\n\n### Educational Outcomes\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will gain a deep understanding of how to identify maxima and minima in quadratic functions, interpret the significance of critical points, and appreciate the connection between a function and its derivative. This understanding fosters critical thinking skills as students analyze relationships between rates of change and their graphical representations, solidifying their grasp of essential calculus concepts.",
