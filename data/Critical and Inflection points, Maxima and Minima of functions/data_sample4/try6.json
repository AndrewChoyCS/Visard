    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives to identify critical points in a quadratic function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height of a projectile, specifically through the use of derivatives. This visualization should illustrate the parabolic graph of the height function \\( h(t) = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\) and clearly mark the critical point where the derivative is zero, indicating the maximum height. The goal is to visually communicate how the slope of the function relates to the height and to emphasize the relationship between the function, its derivative, and the significance of critical points in optimization. \n\nTo achieve this, consider using a combination of a graph depicting the quadratic function alongside a graphic for its derivative, with labels indicating key points such as the maximum height and critical points. Key educational outcomes include grasping how derivatives help identify maxima and minima of functions, understanding the trajectory of projectile motion, and recognizing the application of critical point analysis in real-world scenarios. \n\nBy visually delineating these relationships and sequences, the learner will deepen their understanding of how to apply calculus concepts to physical phenomena.",
