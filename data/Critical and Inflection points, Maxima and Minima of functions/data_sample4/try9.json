    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the derivative of a function and its critical points, particularly how to identify maxima and minima in a quadratic function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how the derivative of a quadratic function determines its maximum height through its critical points. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between the height function \\( h \\), its derivative \\( h' \\), and the critical points where the slope is zero. This visualization should include a graph of the quadratic height function, annotated to show where the derivative equals zero, along with a second graph of the derivative function, clearly showing the slope and identifying the maximum height. \n\nThe visualization style could be a combination of a dual-axis graph that juxtaposes both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( h'(t) \\) with color coding to differentiate between the functions. This design will enhance understanding of how the derivative indicates increasing and decreasing intervals of the height function and visually pinpoint the critical point at which the maximum height occurs. By providing this graphical representation, learners will deeply grasp how to find maxima and minima using derivatives, fostering a thorough understanding of critical points in quadratic functions.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to identify and interpret critical points in the context of quadratic functions, specifically understanding how the derivative serves as a tool to find maxima and minima, enhancing their ability to analyze and visualize mathematical relationships.",
