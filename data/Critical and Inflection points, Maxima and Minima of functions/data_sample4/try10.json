    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle: Understanding Maximum Height Using Derivatives**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of finding the maximum height of a function using derivatives, specifically the example of a ball thrown into the air where its height is defined by the equation \\( h = 3 + 14t - 5t^2 \\). The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationship between the height of the ball and time, as well as the process of deriving the function to locate critical points. This visualization should clearly depict the quadratic graph of the height function, label the critical point where the slope (the derivative) is zero, and indicate the maximum height achieved.\n\nThe visualization can be in the form of a combination of a graph along with annotations and step-by-step illustrations that represent the calculation of the derivative, finding the critical point, and evaluating the height at that time. Including an animated element to show the ball's ascent and descent will further reinforce the concept of maxima and minima. This visual aids in understanding how derivatives help identify maximum points in a function and how those correspond to real-world scenarios, enhancing learners' comprehension of graph behaviors and critical points.\n\n**Objective:**\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of how derivatives are used to identify maximum and minimum values of a quadratic function, comprehend the significance of critical points in real-world contexts, and apply this concept to similar problems in physics and mathematics. The emphasis will be on recognizing the functional relationships between variables, understanding the calculus methods applied, and interpreting graphically the results derived from mathematical principles.",
