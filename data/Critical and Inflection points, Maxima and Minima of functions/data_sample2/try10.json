    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The distinction between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in mathematical functions. This visualization should clearly illustrate the relationships between the function's critical points and the overall behavior of the function. It should depict graphs that show an absolute maximum, an absolute minimum, a relative maximum, and a relative minimum, highlighting the compliance of function values relative to a given point \\( x = c \\). \n\nThe visualization could use a combination of line graphs and marked points to delineate each type of maximum and minimum, with annotations that describe their properties and the open intervals surrounding relative extrema. This clear, engaging graphic will aid learners in understanding how these extrema differ based on the context of the domain and neighboring points, thereby strengthening their grasp of critical points and the behavior of functions. \n\n**Learning Objective**: By the end of this visualization, learners will be able to distinguish between absolute and relative extrema, understand their significance in the broader context of function behavior, and apply these concepts to identify and classify maxima and minima in various functions. This deeper understanding aids in navigating function analysis comprehensively.",
