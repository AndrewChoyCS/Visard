    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute and relative maxima and minima in the context of function behavior.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function. The goal is to illustrate the differences between these concepts in a clear, intuitive manner. Specifically, the visualization should highlight how absolute maxima and minima apply to the entire domain of the function, while relative maxima and minima are confined to local intervals. Suggested visualization styles include a multi-graph diagram that depicts curves representing functions, with clear markings for points of maximum and minimum. Incorporating interactive elements, such as hover-over descriptions for each point, can deepen understanding by emphasizing the relationships between the function's value and its critical points. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students should be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative extrema on a graph, understand their significance within the context of a function, and apply this knowledge to analyze the behavior of various functions effectively. This objective focuses on achieving a thorough understanding of critical points in the study of calculus and their implications in real-world scenarios.",
