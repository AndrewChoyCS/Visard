    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function. The visualization should depict a function graph where the absolute maximum, relative maximum, absolute minimum, and relative minimum are clearly marked. Use distinct colors and labels for each type of extremum, and consider adding annotations or callouts to explain the criteria for being classified as absolute or relative. The goal is to clarify the relationships between the function\u2019s outputs and the defined points of maximum and minimum, as well as the significance of the domain and intervals involved. By utilizing a graph that emphasizes cause-effect relationships and highlights key points on the function curve, learners will achieve a more profound understanding of how these concepts manifest in mathematical functions.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\n- Students will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative extrema visually.\n- Students will understand the importance of domain and interval in determining maxima and minima.\n- Students will grasp the concept of how function behavior changes around local extrema compared to global extrema.",
