    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The visualization should clearly depict several functions on a graph, highlighting points labeled as absolute and relative maxima and minima. Utilize a combination of line graphs and shaded regions to indicate the overall structure of the function and the characteristics of the critical points within specified intervals. This approach will clarify the concept of how absolute extrema are the highest or lowest values over the entire domain, while relative extrema are only significant within their immediate neighborhoods. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected include a comprehensive understanding of how to identify and differentiate local and global extrema, thus enhancing students' problem-solving skills in calculus. By visually emphasizing relationships between points and the function's behavior, learners will achieve a deeper insight into the critical characteristics of functions and their graphical representations.\n\n**Objective:** To enable students to accurately identify and compare absolute and relative maxima and minima of functions by interpreting visual representations, enhancing their ability to apply these concepts in mathematical analysis and real-world applications.",
