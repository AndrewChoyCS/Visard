    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of functions.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. This visualization should include two layered graphs: one depicting an example of a function that highlights its absolute maximum and minimum, and another representing a function showcasing its local maxima and minima. The goal is to clarify the differences in the criteria for identifying these points\u2014illustrating how absolute maxima and minima relate to the entire domain, while relative maxima and minima pertain only to the surrounding interval. \n\nIncorporate elements such as color-coding (e.g., using distinct colors for absolute versus relative points), arrows to indicate intervals, and annotations to reinforce definitions. This will deepen learners' understanding of how these concepts are interconnected and how they function within various contexts of a graph, promoting visual differentiation between them.\n\n### Educational Objective:\nTo develop learners\u2019 critical understanding of how and where maxima and minima occur in a function, and to enhance their ability to identify and categorize these points based on the context of the entire domain versus localized intervals. By engaging with the visual, learners will also improve their skills in analyzing functions graphically, fostering a more robust comprehension of critical and inflection points.",
