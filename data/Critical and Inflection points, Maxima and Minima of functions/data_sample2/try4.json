    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima for a function f(x). The goal of the visualization is to clearly delineate the characteristics and conditions under which each type occurs, using distinct graphs to illustrate global maxima/minima and local maxima/minima. This should help learners understand the underlying relationships and conditions, such as domain restrictions and intervals, that define these critical points of a function. \n\nUtilize a combination of line graphs to represent a function and its behavior at the critical points, alongside labeled zones to indicate areas of local and global maxima and minima. Incorporating color coding and graphical annotations will enhance clarity and enable learners to identify and differentiate between these concepts effectively. The visual should emphasize how these points influence the overall shape and trend of the function.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of how to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima, allowing them to analyze functions comprehensively and understand their critical points' significance in calculus.",
