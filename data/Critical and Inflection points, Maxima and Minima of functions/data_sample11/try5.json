    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concepts of global and local maxima and minima in functions.** The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate the differences between global and local extrema through distinct graphical representations of functions. It should depict several curves showing examples of global maxima, local maxima, global minima, and local minima, effectively labeling each point of interest. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of graphical infographics that highlight the relationships and hierarchies among these concepts by clearly marking boundaries around local neighborhoods. Additionally, including annotations that explain the conditions for each type of maximum and minimum, possibly through interactive elements, would aid in reinforcing the distinctions. \n\nThe ultimate educational outcome is to help learners grasp the critical points where function values reach their highest or lowest relative to a wider domain or vicinity, thereby deepening their understanding of critical and inflection points. The visualization not only simplifies the complex relationships but also allows for comparative analysis by showing multiple functions on similar axes, enhancing the learner's insight into how various functions behave.",
