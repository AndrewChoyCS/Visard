    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe concept of **global and local maxima and minima** in mathematical functions, specifically how these are defined in terms of inequalities within a function's domain.\n\n### Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of global and local maxima and minima in mathematical functions. The goal is to visually represent the conditions under which a function achieves global and local maxima and minima by plotting a function graphically. The visualization should include distinct graphical elements that clearly indicate critical points (both maxima and minima) and illustrate the inequalities that define these points within their respective neighborhoods. Using line graphs combined with shaded regions to indicate the inequalities would effectively clarify the relationships between points on the function and their respective maxima and minima. \n\nThis visual representation will deepen understanding by clearly demonstrating how the function behaves near these critical points, highlighting the cause-and-effect nature of the inequalities. The expected educational outcomes include learners being able to identify and distinguish between global and local extrema, understand their significance, and apply this knowledge when analyzing functions in different contexts.\n\n### Objective\nTo enable students to critically analyze and accurately identify global and local maxima and minima within mathematical functions, enhancing their comprehension of function behavior, optimization, and the application of inequalities in calculus.",
