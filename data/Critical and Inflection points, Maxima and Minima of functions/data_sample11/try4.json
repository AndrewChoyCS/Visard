    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The distinction between global and local maxima and minima of a function along with their definitions in terms of inequalities.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concepts of global and local maxima and minima of a function. The visualization should clearly delineate the relationships between points in a function's domain and their corresponding function values. It ought to contrast global maxima and minima with local maxima and minima, using graphs to illustrate how these points are identified based on the inequalities specified in the text. The goal is to make visible the differences in the vicinity and overall domain of the function, emphasizing the relationships among critical points and how they influence the overall behavior of the function. \n\nSuggest using a combination of line graphs to depict the function alongside labeled points indicating local and global extrema, supplemented by a color-coded shading technique that marks areas of local and global maxima and minima. This approach will help learners see how the function behaves across its domain and understand how these points are determined, supporting **key educational outcomes** such as  identifying critical points in a function and understanding their implications for the function's shape and behavior.\n\n**Objective**: To achieve a deep understanding of how local and global extrema are defined and identified through inequalities, enabling learners to effectively analyze functions for maxima and minima while recognizing their significance in calculus and real-world applications.",
