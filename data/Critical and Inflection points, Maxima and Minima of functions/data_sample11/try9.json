    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concepts of global and local maxima and minima of a function, as articulated in the provided text.** The goal is to visually represent the conditions under which a function achieves global and local maximum and minimum values, emphasizing the inequalities that define these points. By utilizing graphs of various functions, the visualization should illustrate the relationship between the function's values at specific points and their surroundings, clearly labeling local and global extremes. \n\nA combination of infographics and diagrams will be effective in clarifying these concepts, allowing the viewer to see how the function behaves in relation to critical points. Arrows can indicate the relationship between function values within certain neighborhoods, while markers can denote maxima and minima. This visualization will foster a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships between a function's behavior and critical points, ultimately facilitating learners' ability to identify and analyze maxima and minima in various contexts.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to achieve a nuanced and deep understanding of how the concepts of global and local extrema relate to a function's behavior and the critical points where these extrema occur. By actively engaging with the visual representation, learners will develop the skills necessary to analyze and interpret functions, enhancing their grasp of critical points and characterization of maximum and minimum values.",
