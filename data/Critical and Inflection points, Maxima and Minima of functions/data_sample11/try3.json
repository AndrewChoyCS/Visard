    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The differentiation between global and local maxima and minima of a function, including their definitions and contextual relationships.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concepts of global and local maxima and minima for functions. This visualization should clearly differentiate between the two types of extrema, showing how a global maximum at point \\( x = c \\) compares to local maxima in surrounding areas, as well as how global and local minima are defined similarly. The specific concept aims to clarify the hierarchical structure of these extrema by using different graphs to represent functions that illustrate both global and local maxima/minima, alongside labeled inequalities that demonstrate their relationships. An appropriate style for this visualization would be a combination of graphs and annotated diagrams, effectively illustrating how each type of maximum and minimum is situated within the function's overall behavior. This visual will enhance learners\u2019 understanding by visually mapping these relationships and providing them with an intuitive grasp of the distinctions and implications of these mathematical concepts.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of the relationships between global and local maxima/minima, enabling them to identify and interpret these points within various functions and apply this knowledge in problem-solving scenarios. They will gain the ability to visualize how these points are defined and distinguished graphically, reinforcing their understanding of critical and inflection points.",
