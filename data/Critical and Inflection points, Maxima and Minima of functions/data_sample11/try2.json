    "data": "A function f(x) is said to achieve a global maximum at x = c if for every x within its domain, the inequality f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) holds. Similarly, f(x) exhibits a local maximum at x = c if f(x) is less than or equal to f(c) for every x within some vicinity around c. Conversely, f(x) is considered to attain a global minimum at x = c if, for all x in the domain, it satisfies f(x) being greater than or equal to f(c). On the other hand, f(x) has a local minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) for every x within a certain open neighborhood surrounding c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The distinction between global and local maxima and minima in a function.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concepts of global and local maxima and minima of a function f(x). The goal is to provide clarity on how a function can achieve maximum or minimum values both on a global scale (across its entire domain) and within a localized area (surrounding specific points). This visualization should depict graphs illustrating a function with clearly marked global maximum, local maximum, global minimum, and local minimum points. A layered approach or segmented graphs would be effective to show the hierarchical relationships between local and global extrema and to delineate their defining neighborhoods. By integrating different graph styles\u2014like line graphs for the function itself and highlighted regions for these extrema\u2014the visual will enhance understanding of the distinctions, aiding students in applying these concepts in problem-solving contexts.\n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will gain a robust understanding of the differences between global and local maxima and minima, enabling them to identify and analyze critical points of functions effectively. This foundational knowledge will support their ability to explore optimization problems and calculus applications.",
