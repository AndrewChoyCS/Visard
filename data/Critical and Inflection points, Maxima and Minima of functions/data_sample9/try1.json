    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima in functions.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the differences between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of functions. The visualization should include two distinct graphs: one illustrating an absolute maximum and minimum across a domain, and another highlighting local maxima and minima within specific neighborhoods. The goal is to clarify the concepts of how these extrema differ in terms of their definitions and implications in the context of the function\u2019s behavior. \n\nThe desired educational outcomes include an understanding of how to identify absolute versus relative extrema, as well as the contexts in which each type is relevant. Use a clear line graph style with labeled axes and points of interest to demonstrate these relationships visually. The visual should employ contrasting colors or markers to emphasize maxima and minima, making distinctions easily recognizable. By providing an intuitive representation of these mathematical concepts, learners will deepen their understanding of critical points and their significance in analyzing function characteristics. \n\n**Objective:** Analyze and distinguish between absolute and relative maxima and minima of functions through visual representation, enhancing comprehension of critical points within function behavior.",
