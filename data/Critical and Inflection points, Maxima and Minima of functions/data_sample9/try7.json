    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe distinction between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions, highlighting their definitions in terms of the value of \\(f(x)\\) compared to \\(f(c)\\) across the defined domain or in a local neighborhood around \\(x = c\\).\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The goal is to illustrate the differences between these types of extrema in a clear and intuitive manner. Specifically, the visualization should clarify how an absolute maximum is determined globally, while relative maxima are localized, along with similarly distinguishing absolute and relative minima. \n\nConsider using a combination of line graphs and shaded areas to represent the function \\(f(x)\\), labeling points \\(c\\) for both maxima and minima, and using color-coding to differentiate absolute from relative points. The visual should also include annotations indicating the value of \\(f(c)\\) compared to surrounding points and should emphasize the contextual neighborhood for relative extrema. \n\nThis approach enables learners to grasp the hierarchical relationships between extreme points and deepens their understanding of how these concepts interrelate within the broader framework of function analysis. \n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will be able to differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions, effectively applying these concepts to analyze graphical representations and interpret their mathematical significance in real-world contexts.",
