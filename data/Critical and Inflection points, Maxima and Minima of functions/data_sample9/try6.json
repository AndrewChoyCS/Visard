    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\n\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, as well as their definitions and implications within the function\u2019s domain.\n\n### Query:\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function. The goal is to depict both global and local extremes effectively, illustrating where these points occur on the graph of a function, and how they differ in terms of their definitions. This visualization should clarify the relationships between points in the function\u2019s domain and their corresponding function values.\n\nThe ideal format would be a multi-part graph that includes: \n1. A continuous function showcasing both absolute maxima and minima, clearly labeled.\n2. Close-up segments around local maxima and minima that demonstrate how these points behave in their respective neighborhoods.\n3. Annotations that highlight the definitions and implications of each type of extreme.\n\nBy integrating a line graph with highlighted sections, along with side notes, this visual will aid students in understanding the distinction between absolute and relative extremes in a clear, engaging manner. \n\n### Educational Outcome Objective:\n\nStudents will achieve a deep comprehension of the characteristics and significance of absolute and relative maxima and minima, enabling them to identify these points in various functions and understand their implications on function behavior across different domains.",
