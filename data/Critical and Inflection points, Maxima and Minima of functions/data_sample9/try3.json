Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima in mathematical functions. The goal is to clearly illustrate the difference between these two types of extrema, highlighting how absolute maxima and minima relate to the overall function across its entire domain, while local maxima and minima pertain to specific neighborhoods within that function. \n\nIncorporate diagrams that depict a continuous function along with clearly labeled points representing both absolute and relative maxima and minima. Using different colors or markers can enhance clarity. This visual should facilitate a deeper understanding of how these concepts relate to critical and inflection points in a function's behavior, helping learners to identify and differentiate between global and local extremities effectively.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima within mathematical functions, understanding their significance in the broader context of function analysis, including critical and inflection points. This foundational knowledge will aid in further studies of calculus and optimization.",
