    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concepts of absolute maxima, relative maxima, absolute minima, and relative minima within the context of a function f(x). The goal is to clearly illustrate how absolute maxima and minima represent the highest and lowest points in the entire domain of the function, while relative maxima and minima capture the behavior of the function in specific neighborhoods around certain points. \n\nThis visualization should incorporate multiple graphs that demonstrate the relationships between these concepts, utilizing different colors or shapes to distinguish between absolute and relative extremes. Consider using an infographic style that combines line graphs of various functions with highlighted points representing maxima and minima. \n\nBy visually differentiating these elements, learners will deepen their understanding of how to identify and interpret critical points in a function's behavior, enhancing their ability to analyze and apply these concepts in calculus. \n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative extrema in mathematical functions, enhancing their ability to analyze function behavior and application in real-world contexts.",
