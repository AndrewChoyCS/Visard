    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) maxima/minima and relative (local) maxima/minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the difference between absolute and relative maxima and minima for a function f(x). The visualization should clearly depict the concept of absolute and relative extrema using graphs of functions with highlighted points that represent global and local maxima and minima. Incorporate multiple graphs to showcase different functions, indicating how critical points change in relation to their defined domains. The goal is to facilitate a deeper understanding of the concept by illustrating the relationships between these extrema, helping learners visually identify the differences in context and scale. \n\nConsider using a combination of line graphs and shaded areas to emphasize the regions of interest for absolute and relative extrema. This approach will enhance learners' ability to distinguish between global and local behaviors of functions, thus reinforcing their comprehension of critical points and inflection within mathematical functions.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in mathematical functions, identifying key characteristics and visual cues that signal these extremal points, thereby developing a robust understanding of the behavior of functions in calculus.",
