    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Differentiating between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function \\( f(x) \\). The visualization should consist of multiple graphs that illustrate a given function with clearly labeled points of absolute maxima, relative maxima, absolute minima, and relative minima. Each point should be visually distinct (e.g., using different colors or symbols), and areas depicting neighborhoods for relative extrema should be highlighted. This will clarify the concept of how maxima and minima are determined both in a broader context (absolute) and within localized sections of a graph (relative).\n\nBy employing a combination of line graphs to show the function and scatter plots for critical points, the visual will aid in understanding the relationships between these concepts and how they manifest in function behavior. This design will deepen learners' insight by illustrating the hierarchy of critical points in relation to their corresponding values across the function's domain.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in a function\u2019s graph, thereby enhancing their understanding of critical points and their implications in calculus. This will empower them to analyze functions more effectively, recognizing patterns and behaviors that define their characteristics.",
