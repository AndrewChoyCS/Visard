    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the distinction between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function f(x). The goal is to clearly illustrate how absolute maximum and minimum points represent the highest and lowest values of the function over its entire domain, while relative maximum and minimum points show local peaks and valleys within a specific neighborhood. Use a clear graph style that includes multiple curves of different functions to highlight these critical points. Integrate labeled annotations to distinguish between absolute and relative points, and use color coding to differentiate between maxima and minima. This visual representation will assist learners in understanding the underlying relationships between these concepts and reinforce the cause-effect dynamics of function behavior.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will accurately identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in various functions, enhancing their skills in analyzing and interpreting function behavior with respect to critical and inflection points.",
