    "data": "A function f(x) is described to have an absolute (or global) maximum at the point x = c if the value of f(x) does not exceed f(c) for all x in its defined domain. Conversely, f(x) is said to possess a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if f(x) remains less than or equal to f(c) within a certain neighborhood surrounding x = c. Likewise, we refer to f(x) as having an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if every value of f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) across its domain. On the other hand, f(x) is noted to have a relative (or local) minimum at x = c when f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) in some interval close to x = c.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima in functions, highlighting their definitions and significance within a function's domain.\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The goal of this visual representation is to clearly delineate the differences between global and local extrema on a graph of a function, illustrating points of maxima and minima relative to their surroundings and across the entire domain. The visualization should highlight cause-effect relationships by showcasing how local extrema can occur within a specific neighborhood while not necessarily representing the overall highest or lowest points of the function.\n\n### Suggested Visualization Style:\nA two-part diagram could be effective: one graph depicting a function with clear indications of absolute and relative maxima and minima, and another graph illustrating an example where local extrema occur without being global extrema. Use labels and annotations to clarify the critical points, showcasing the neighborhood around local points and the overall domain for global points.\n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nLearners will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima, understand their significance in the analysis of functions, and visualize these concepts accurately in relation to the entire function's behavior. This deep understanding emphasizes the hierarchy of function behavior, allowing students to apply these concepts effectively in problem-solving scenarios involving critical and inflection points.",
