In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, as well as their definitions in terms of open intervals, is a key concept that can be effectively communicated through visualization.\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function f(x).** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate the concepts of absolute and relative maxima and minima, showing how these points relate to the function's values both globally and locally. This visual representation should highlight the definitions and conditions for attaining absolute and relative extremes by using multiple graphs of varying functions. \n\nUtilizing line graphs with labeled points that indicate local and global extrema will effectively convey the relationships between function values within open intervals and the overall domain. Incorporating color coding (e.g., red for maxima, blue for minima) will help differentiate between the concepts, while annotations will clarify the underlying conditions that determine local versus global extrema. \n\nThis visualization should aim to deepen understanding by emphasizing the context of these points, making the concept of maxima and minima intuitive and accessible. With a focus on the relationships inherent in function behavior, students will grasp not just the \"what\" but the \"why\" behind identifying these critical points.\n\n### Learning Objective\nStudents will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions, understand their significance within the overall context of the function's behavior, and apply this understanding to analyze various mathematical functions critically.",
