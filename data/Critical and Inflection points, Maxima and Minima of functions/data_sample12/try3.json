    "data": "A function f(x) attains an absolute (or global) maximum at x = c if its values are always less than or equal to f(c) across the entire domain. In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Differentiation between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima for functions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the difference between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function. The visualization should clearly differentiate between these concepts by using two distinct graphs: one for absolute extrema and one for relative extrema. Each graph should be annotated to show the values of f(c) and the behavior of the function around c, highlighting how the function's values compare to f(c) across the entire domain and within a surrounding interval. The educational outcome is to ensure students grasp the relationships between maximum and minimum points in the context of a function\u2019s domain, fostering a deeper understanding of critical and inflection points. \n\n**Visualization Style:** A side-by-side comparison infographic that illustrates both absolute and relative extrema, using color-coded curves to distinguish between the different types. Annotations should point out the relevant characteristics of each maximum and minimum, assisting in visual learning and retention.\n\n**Objective:** To enable students to clearly identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima, fostering critical analysis of function behavior and enhancing their problem-solving skills in calculus.",
