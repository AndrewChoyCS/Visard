    "data": "A function f(x) attains an absolute (or global) maximum at x = c if its values are always less than or equal to f(c) across the entire domain. In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, including the conditions that define them.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the conditions under which a function attains these points, highlighting the contrasts between global and local characteristics. It should illustrate the function\u2019s behavior on a graph, depicting key points, intervals, and the relationships of values at and around these critical points. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of an infographic that combines labeled graphs showing a function with clear markings for absolute maximum, absolute minimum, relative maximum, and relative minimum points. Utilizing color coding for different types of maxima/minima, alongside intervals illustrating the local nature of these points, will foster a comparative analysis. This visual will deepen understanding by articulating cause-effect relationships between the points on the graph and their descriptions, enhancing learners\u2019 grasp of how function behavior can vary at different scales.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Develop a profound understanding of how to identify and differentiate absolute and relative maxima and minima on a function graph, incorporating their definitions and implications for function analysis in calculus.",
