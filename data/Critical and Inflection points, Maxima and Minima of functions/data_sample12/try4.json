    "data": "A function f(x) attains an absolute (or global) maximum at x = c if its values are always less than or equal to f(c) across the entire domain. In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima for functions. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how a function f(x) reaches global and local extrema. It should present multiple graphs that depict a function's behavior, highlighting points of absolute maxima and minima, as well as relative maxima and minima. The visualization should utilize colored regions to represent the open intervals for relative extrema and label these intervals clearly, using curves that show various function behaviors across their domains.\n\nThe specific concept intended to be clarified here is the relationship between absolute and relative extrema, emphasizing how the former relates to the entire domain while the latter is confined to local neighborhoods around points. Suggested styles include layered line plots and annotated diagrams, ideally structured to compare global versus local behaviors side by side. This visual aid will deepen understanding by showcasing the cause-effect relationships inherent in different types of extrema, allowing learners to easily identify and differentiate between the concepts visually.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visual presentation, learners will be able to differentiate between absolute and relative extrema, articulate the conditions that define each, and recognize how these concepts manifest across different types of functions.",
