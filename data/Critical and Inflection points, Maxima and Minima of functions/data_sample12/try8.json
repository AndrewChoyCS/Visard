    "data": "A function f(x) attains an absolute (or global) maximum at x = c if its values are always less than or equal to f(c) across the entire domain. In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function and how they are defined based on the function's behavior across its domain and in surrounding intervals.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the differences between absolute and relative maxima and minima in functions. The goal is to clarify how absolute maxima/minima compare to relative maxima/minima, illustrating their conditions across the function's domain and within specific intervals. This visual representation should include multiple graphs\u2014one clearly depicting an absolute maximum and another showing a relative maximum, as well as corresponding graphs for minima. An infographic format would be effective, with labeled axes and highlighted regions to indicate the behavior of the function around critical points. This visualization should help learners grasp the hierarchical nature of these points, how they relate to the overall behavior of functions, and enhance their ability to identify these characteristics graphically.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate between absolute and relative maxima and minima of a function, understanding their definitions, conditions, and significance within the context of critical points, thereby deepening their comprehension of function behavior and analysis.",
