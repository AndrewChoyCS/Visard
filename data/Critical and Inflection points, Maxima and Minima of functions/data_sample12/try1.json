    "data": "A function f(x) attains an absolute (or global) maximum at x = c if its values are always less than or equal to f(c) across the entire domain. In contrast, a function f(x) has a relative (or local) maximum at x = c if there is a surrounding open interval around c where f(x) is less than or equal to f(c). On a similar note, a function f(x) has an absolute (or global) minimum at x = c if its values are always greater than or equal to f(c) throughout the subject domain. Meanwhile, f(x) experiences a relative (or local) minimum at x = c if it holds true that f(x) is greater than or equal to f(c) within an open interval situated around c.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The distinction between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function, and their definitions concerning the function's behavior across its domain and within specific intervals.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the difference between absolute (global) and relative (local) maxima and minima of a function. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how a function\u2019s behavior at a particular point \\( x = c \\) can be described in terms of its entire domain (absolute) or in the context of surrounding values (relative). The specific concept intended to be clarified is the definition of these maxima and minima and the relationships between the function values at \\( x = c \\) and neighboring points. \n\nThis visualization could take the form of a dual graph display: one graph illustrating absolute maxima and minima across the entire function and another focusing on local maxima and minima within defined intervals. By employing contrasting colors and labels to emphasize regions of interest, this visual will aid in understanding the hierarchies and relationships inherent in the function's behavior. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how absolute and relative extrema are identified and differentiated, allowing them to apply this knowledge in analyzing functions and determining critical points effectively.",
