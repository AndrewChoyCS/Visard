    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Understanding the behavior of a function at critical points using the first derivative to determine local maxima, local minima, and points of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first order derivative test for identifying local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a function. The visualization should illustrate the concept of how the first derivative behaves as it approaches critical points. Incorporate graphs that show a function alongside its first derivative, clearly indicating where the derivative crosses zero and how it transitions between positive and negative values. The goal is to highlight the sequential relationships of increases and decreases in slope that lead to maxima and minima, as well as flat points indicating inflection. Use a combination of line graphs and color-coded sections to represent different behaviors of the derivative, ensuring that each section is clearly labeled and annotated for easy comprehension. This visualization will greatly aid students in understanding the practical implications of the derivative's behavior, fostering a deep understanding of critical points within the context of calculus.\n\n**Educational Objective:** By the end of the instructional session, students will be able to accurately interpret and analyze the behavior of a continuous function at critical points using the first derivative, identifying local maxima and minima as well as points of inflection based on the changes in the slope, thus enhancing their capability to apply calculus concepts to real-world scenarios.",
