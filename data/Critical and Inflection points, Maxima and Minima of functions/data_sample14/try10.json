    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first derivative around a critical point determines whether that point is a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first derivative test for determining points of maxima, minima, and inflection points in a continuous function. The goal is to clarify how the first derivative's sign changes around the critical point \\(c\\) (where \\(f'(c) = 0\\) ) and how this relates to local maxima or minima. The expected educational outcomes include the ability to distinguish between local maxima, minima, and inflection points through direct observation of derivative behavior. This visualization should employ a combination of line graphs depicting a continuous function alongside its first derivative, with clearly labeled transitions between positive and negative slopes. \n\nBy illustrating these relationships, the visual aids learners in understanding how slope changes relate to the function's behavior at critical points, enhancing their grasp of critical calculus concepts and reinforcing the cause-effect relationships involved.",
