    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: Understanding Critical Points and Their Classification Using the First Derivative Test**\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of critical points and their classification as local maxima, local minima, or points of inflection using the first derivative test. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the behavior of the first derivative around critical point \\( c \\) and how changes in its sign indicate maxima, minima, or points of inflection. Specifically, the visualization should clarify the relationships between the function's slope, the value of the first derivative, and the output of the function at critical points. \n\nAn effective approach would be to use a combination of line graphs to show the function \\( f \\) and its first derivative \\( f' \\), clearly labeling each critical point along with accompanying annotations to highlight the transitions in slope. Including color-coded regions for maxima, minima, and points of inflection can enhance comprehension. This visual representation will deepen learners' understanding of how to analyze the behavior of functions and apply the first derivative test effectively. \n\n**Educational Objective:**\nStudents will be able to identify and classify critical points of a continuous function based on the first derivative test, enhancing their ability to analyze functions in calculus accurately.",
