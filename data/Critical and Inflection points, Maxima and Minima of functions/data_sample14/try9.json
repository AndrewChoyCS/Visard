    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the first derivative of a function and the identification of local maxima, minima, and points of inflection.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the first order derivative test for identifying local maxima and minima, as well as points of inflection in a continuous function. The visualization should clearly illustrate how the first derivative\u2019s sign changes around a critical point\u2014specifically, the transitions from positive to negative (indicating a local maximum) and from negative to positive (indicating a local minimum), alongside sections where the sign remains unchanged (indicating a point of inflection). \n\nUsing a combination of graphs, arrows, and color-coded regions, depict the function, its first derivative, and the critical points in a sequential manner that emphasizes the cause-effect relationships between the sign of the derivative and the classification of points. This approach should facilitate a deeper understanding of how the behavior of the derivative influences the nature of critical points, ultimately helping students to identify and analyze these points in broader contexts.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a robust comprehension of how the first derivative relates to identifying critical points, allowing students to confidently analyze and interpret the behavior of functions in relation to their derivatives, enhancing their analytical skills in calculus.",
