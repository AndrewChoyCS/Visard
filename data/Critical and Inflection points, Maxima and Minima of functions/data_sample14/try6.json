    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first derivative around critical points indicates whether these points are local maxima, minima, or inflection points.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first order derivative test and its implications for identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points in a function. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how the first derivative's sign changes as we approach a critical point (c), showing the transitions from positive to negative and vice versa, along with the scenarios that lead to identifying inflection points. A combination of line graphs and annotated points would effectively visualize the relationships among the function, its derivative, and the critical points. This visual should emphasize cause-and-effect relationships, as well as the sequences of derivative behavior leading to the classification of each critical point.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will gain a deep understanding of how to interpret the behavior of derivatives in relation to critical points and how to distinguish between local maxima, minima, and inflection points. They will be able to visualize these concepts holistically and apply this understanding to analyze any continuous function.",
