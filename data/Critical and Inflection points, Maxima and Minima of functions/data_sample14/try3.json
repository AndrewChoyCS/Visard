    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The first order derivative test identifies points of local maxima, minima, and inflection points based on the behavior of the first derivative around critical points.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first order derivative test and its role in identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points in a continuous function. The goal is to illustrate how the first derivative transitions around a critical point (where f'(c) = 0) and what those changes indicate about the function's behavior. This visualization should clarify the cause-and-effect relationships between the sign of the first derivative and the categorization of points as local maxima, minima, or inflection points. \n\nI recommend a combination of line graphs displaying the function alongside plots of its first derivative, marked with critical points and annotations explaining the observed transitions. This approach helps delineate the relationships between the function's slope and its critical points, reinforcing understanding through visual comparison of derivative behavior. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will be able to critically analyze and interpret changes in the first derivative of a function to determine its local maxima, minima, and points of inflection, enhancing their comprehension of differential calculus concepts.",
