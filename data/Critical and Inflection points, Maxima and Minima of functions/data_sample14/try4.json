    "data": "The first order derivative test, as its name implies, utilizes the first derivative to determine points of maxima and minima. The first derivative represents the slope of the function. Let f be a continuous function defined at the critical point c within the open interval l, where f'(c) equals zero. We then analyze the behavior of the function around this point. As we observe x approaching c\u2014our critical point\u2014if the derivative f'(x) transitions from a positive value to a negative value, it indicates that f(c) is the maximum, marking c as a point of local maxima. Conversely, if f'(x) moves from a negative value to a positive value, f(c) becomes the minimum and c is deemed a point of local minima. Alternatively, if the sign of f'(x) remains the same, not shifting from either positive to negative or vice versa, then c is identified as a point of inflection, indicating that it is neither a maximum nor a minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of the first derivative around a critical point determines whether that point is a local maximum, local minimum, or an inflection point based on sign changes.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points of a function. This visualization should illustrate how the sign of the first derivative changes as we approach the critical point \\( c \\). The goal is to clarify the relationships between the function's slope (first derivative), its critical point, and the corresponding classifications of maxima, minima, and inflection points. \n\nThe visualization can incorporate a line graph to depict a function, highlighting the critical point where the derivative equals zero, and overlay it with a signed slope representation showing how \\( f'(x) \\) transitions across that point. An infographic format could effectively communicate this process, emphasizing cause-effect relationships, where changes in the function's slope directly affect the nature of critical points. By emphasizing the sequential progression of the derivative's behavior, learners will gain a deeper understanding of why a function behaves as it does at these key points.\n\n**Objective:** Students will achieve a robust understanding of how the first derivative informs the classification of critical points in functions, allowing them to analyze and predict function behavior in various mathematical contexts effectively.",
