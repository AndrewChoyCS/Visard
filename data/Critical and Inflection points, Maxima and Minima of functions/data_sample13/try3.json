    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe behavior of a continuous function \\( f \\) at its critical point \\( c \\), influenced by the sign changes of its first derivative \\( f' \\), determines whether \\( c \\) is a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the impact of the first-order derivative test on identifying local maxima, minima, and inflection points in a function. This visualization should illustrate a continuous function with its derivative clearly displayed and include labeled points demonstrating where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). The goal is to clarify how the sign changes of the derivative around critical points indicate the nature of these points\u2014whether they are maxima, minima, or inflection points. It would be beneficial to use a combination of line graphs, highlighting the function\u2019s curvature and the corresponding first derivative with arrows to indicate sign changes. \n\nBy visually connecting the derivative\u2019s sign changes to the behavior of the function at critical points, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between a function and its derivative. The expected educational outcome is for students to effectively identify and classify critical points using the first-order derivative test, thereby enhancing their overall grasp of calculus concepts related to maxima, minima, and inflection points.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how the first-order derivative test is employed to recognize and categorize critical points in functions, fostering an ability to analyze various functions\u2019 behavior intuitively and accurately.",
