    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The first-order derivative test provides a method to identify local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a function by analyzing the behavior of its first derivative around critical points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for identifying local maxima, minima, and points of inflection in a continuous function. The visualization should illustrate how the first derivative \\( f'(x) \\) changes signs as \\( x \\) approaches critical point \\( c \\), showcasing transitions from positive to negative for local maxima and negative to positive for local minima. Utilize a combination of line graphs and annotated points to clearly demonstrate these changes, along with a highlighted critical point that represents both possible scenarios of maxima and minima. \n\nThe key educational outcomes expected include the ability for learners to visually correlate the slope of the function (represented by the first derivative) with the locations of maxima and minima, helping them to synthesize and retain the understanding of critical points. This visualization should effectively highlight the relationships between the behavior of the first derivative and the function it derives, fostering clarity and deep comprehension of these foundational concepts in calculus.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to analyze and interpret the behavior of functions around critical points by applying the first-order derivative test through visual representation, enhancing their understanding of how derivative sign changes inform about function behavior.",
