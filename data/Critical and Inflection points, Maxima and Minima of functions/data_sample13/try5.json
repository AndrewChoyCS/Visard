    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of a continuous function near its critical points, particularly how the first derivative's sign change indicates whether a critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the first derivative of a function and its critical points\u2014specifically illustrating how the sign changes of the first derivative inform the identification of local maxima, minima, and points of inflection. The goal is to clearly depict the behavior of \\( f'(x) \\) as it approaches a critical point \\( c \\), showcasing transitions from positive to negative and negative to positive slopes through a series of graphs. This visualization should include a labeled graph of \\( f(x) \\) alongside a corresponding graph of \\( f'(x) \\), highlighting the critical point and indicating areas where the function climbs, descends, or levels off. By using this dual graph format, learners will be able to see the cause-effect relationships between the derivative's sign and the function's behavior, facilitating a deeper understanding of how to analyze critical points and their implications on the function's maxima and minima. \n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will gain a comprehensive understanding of how changes in the first derivative of a function correlate to its critical points, enabling them to apply this analytical tool to effectively identify and justify the nature of maxima, minima, and points of inflection in various continuous functions.",
