    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of a function around its critical points, particularly identifying maxima, minima, and inflection points through the sign changes of its first derivative.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test and its role in identifying maxima and minima in a function. The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate how the first derivative, denoted as \\( f'(x) \\), changes as it approaches a critical point \\( c \\). This visualization should depict the transitions of \\( f'(x) \\)\u2014from positive to negative for local maxima, from negative to positive for local minima, and the absence of sign change at inflection points. \n\nConsider using a well-labeled graph that overlays the function \\( f(x) \\) with its first derivative \\( f'(x) \\), highlighting critical points and showing the slope's behavior. Additionally, integrating color coding can enhance differentiation between maxima, minima, and inflection points. This visual will aid in understanding the cause-effect relationships inherent in derivatives, strengthening learners' insights into identifying local behavior around critical points.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nTo deepen students' understanding of how to determine local maxima, minima, and inflection points of functions through the analysis of the first derivative, emphasizing the relationship between the first derivative's sign changes and the function's behavior at critical points.",
