    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The first-order derivative test helps identify local maxima, minima, and inflection points of a continuous function by analyzing the sign changes of its first derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test by illustrating how the sign changes of the first derivative \\( f'(x) \\) indicate the behavior of the function \\( f(x) \\) around critical point \\( c \\). The visualization should show three distinct graphs: one where \\( f'(x) \\) changes from positive to negative (indicating a local maximum), one where \\( f'(x) \\) changes from negative to positive (indicating a local minimum), and one where \\( f'(x) \\) has no sign change (indicating an inflection point). The key educational outcomes expected are for learners to recognize these critical points visually and understand the relationship between the derivative's sign and the nature of the original function. \n\nThe visualization should use line graphs for the function \\( f(x) \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x) \\), alongside clearly labeled regions for maxima, minima, and inflection points. This approach will aid comprehension by highlighting cause-effect relationships and sequential processes, allowing learners to see not just the properties of the function, but also how the derivative informs those properties clearly and intuitively. \n\n**Objective:** By the end of the visualization exercise, learners will be able to interpret the significance of first-order derivatives in identifying local extrema and inflection points in continuous functions, thereby deepening their conceptual understanding of calculus-derived graphical analysis.",
