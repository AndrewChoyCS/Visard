    "data": "The first-order derivative test serves to identify the locations of maxima and minima in a function using its first derivative. This derivative indicates the slope of the given function. Let \\( f \\) be a continuous function on the interval \\( l \\) with a critical point \\( c \\) where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). To analyze how the function behaves around this critical point, we examine the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\). If \\( f'(x) \\) transitions from positive to negative, then \\( f(c) \\) represents the maximum value, and \\( c \\) is deemed a point of local maxima. Conversely, if \\( f'(x) \\) shifts from negative to positive, then \\( f(c) \\) indicates the minimum value, making \\( c \\) a local minima. If there is no change in sign for \\( f'(x) \\), then \\( c \\) is recognized as a point of inflection, where neither maxima nor minima occurs.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The behavior of a continuous function at critical points, specifically how the first derivative's sign changes determine local maxima, minima, and inflection points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the first-order derivative test for identifying maxima and minima in a function. The goal is to illustrate how the sign changes of the first derivative around a critical point (where \\( f'(c) = 0 \\)) affect the behavior of the function. This visualization should clarify the concept of critical points and their classifications based on the slopes surrounding them\u2014depicting areas of increasing and decreasing function values with clear indicators for local maxima, local minima, and points of inflection.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a multi-layered graph that includes the following elements: a continuous function curve, its first derivative plotted alongside, and distinctly marked critical points with arrows indicating the direction of sign changes. This layered approach will help students grasp the relationships among the function, its derivative, and the implications of these relationships for determining maxima and minima. By illustrating these critical concepts, learners will develop a deeper understanding of how mathematical analysis relates to graphical behavior, which is a central objective in calculus and function analysis. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and classify critical points of a function based on the analysis of its first derivative, understanding the implications of sign changes in determining local maxima and minima, and connecting these concepts to the geometric interpretation of functions.",
