    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is launched upward into the sky. The height of the object at any moment, t, can be represented by the equation: h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2. To determine its peak height, we can utilize derivatives to compute the function's slope. The derivative of height with respect to time is: h' = 0 + 10 - 5t, simplifying to h' = 10 - 5t. Next, we set the slope equal to zero to find the time when the height reaches its maximum: 10 - 5t = 0, which simplifies to 5t = 10, thus t = 10 / 5 = 2 seconds. Hence, we know that the slope equals zero at t = 2 seconds. At this instant, we can calculate the corresponding height: h = 4 + 10\u00d72 - 2.5\u00d7(2)\u00b2, leading to h = 4 + 20 - 10 = 14. Therefore, the peak height attained is 14 meters at t = 2 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of deriving a function to find its maximum height\u2014specifically identifying critical points and understanding the relationship between the derivative and the peak value.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain how to find the maximum height of an object launched upwards using derivatives. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between the height function, its derivative, and the critical point where the maximum height occurs. Specifically, the visualization should illustrate the sequence of steps taken to derive the function, identify where the slope equals zero, and compute the maximum height. Suggested visualization styles could include a layered diagram showing the height function alongside its derivative, as well as an annotated graph plotting height versus time with a clear indication of critical points. \n\nThis visual aid will deepen understanding by illustrating the cause-effect relationships inherent in finding maxima and minima in functions, highlighting how changes in the slope relate to the motion of the object. The expected educational outcome is for students to grasp the significance of derivatives in determining peak values and to be able to visually analyze critical points within a function graphically.",
