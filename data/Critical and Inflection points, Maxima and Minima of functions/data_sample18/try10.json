    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is launched upward into the sky. The height of the object at any moment, t, can be represented by the equation: h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2. To determine its peak height, we can utilize derivatives to compute the function's slope. The derivative of height with respect to time is: h' = 0 + 10 - 5t, simplifying to h' = 10 - 5t. Next, we set the slope equal to zero to find the time when the height reaches its maximum: 10 - 5t = 0, which simplifies to 5t = 10, thus t = 10 / 5 = 2 seconds. Hence, we know that the slope equals zero at t = 2 seconds. At this instant, we can calculate the corresponding height: h = 4 + 10\u00d72 - 2.5\u00d7(2)\u00b2, leading to h = 4 + 20 - 10 = 14. Therefore, the peak height attained is 14 meters at t = 2 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The peak height of a projectile can be determined using derivatives, specifically by identifying when the slope of the height function equals zero, indicating a maximum point.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between the height of a projectile over time and how derivatives are used to determine its maximum height. The goal is to clearly illustrate the height function \\( h(t) = 4 + 10t - 2.5t^2 \\), its derivative \\( h'(t) = 10 - 5t \\), and the point where the slope equals zero, indicating the peak height. This visualization should include a graph depicting both the height function and its derivative, highlighting the critical points, and an annotation indicating the maximum height at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds. \n\nTo achieve this, I suggest using a line graph style for both the height and the slope, perhaps with distinct colors to differentiate the two functions. Include clear labels, markers for important points, and a legend to enhance comprehension. This visual will support learners in understanding the concept of maxima and minima and the cause-effect relationship between the function and its derivative, ultimately deepening their understanding of how derivatives inform us about the behavior of functions. \n\n**Objective:** Students will deeply understand how to identify critical points of a function using derivatives, enhancing their capability to analyze and predict the behavior of polynomial functions in contexts such as projectile motion.",
