    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is launched upward into the sky. The height of the object at any moment, t, can be represented by the equation: h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2. To determine its peak height, we can utilize derivatives to compute the function's slope. The derivative of height with respect to time is: h' = 0 + 10 - 5t, simplifying to h' = 10 - 5t. Next, we set the slope equal to zero to find the time when the height reaches its maximum: 10 - 5t = 0, which simplifies to 5t = 10, thus t = 10 / 5 = 2 seconds. Hence, we know that the slope equals zero at t = 2 seconds. At this instant, we can calculate the corresponding height: h = 4 + 10\u00d72 - 2.5\u00d7(2)\u00b2, leading to h = 4 + 20 - 10 = 14. Therefore, the peak height attained is 14 meters at t = 2 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the height of an object in motion, represented by a quadratic function, and the determination of its peak height using derivatives.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of finding the peak height of an object launched into the sky using its height equation \\( h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2 \\). The visualization should illustrate the parabolic graph of the height function, highlighting the point at which the derivative (slope) reaches zero, indicating the maximum height. Additionally, depict the derivative function \\( h' = 10 - 5t \\) on a separate graph to show how it intersects the x-axis at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds, reinforcing the concept of critical points and maximizing functions.\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between the original function and its derivative, emphasizing how critical points are determined in the analysis of motion. Using a combination of graphs, arrows, and labels, this visual should support learners in grasping the concepts of maxima and minima in quadratic functions, highlight the sequential process of differentiation, and illustrate how the underlying mathematical principles apply to real-world scenarios. A clear understanding of critical points, slope, and peak height is expected as the key educational outcome, enhancing the learner's ability to interpret quadratic functions in physical contexts.",
