    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is launched upward into the sky. The height of the object at any moment, t, can be represented by the equation: h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2. To determine its peak height, we can utilize derivatives to compute the function's slope. The derivative of height with respect to time is: h' = 0 + 10 - 5t, simplifying to h' = 10 - 5t. Next, we set the slope equal to zero to find the time when the height reaches its maximum: 10 - 5t = 0, which simplifies to 5t = 10, thus t = 10 / 5 = 2 seconds. Hence, we know that the slope equals zero at t = 2 seconds. At this instant, we can calculate the corresponding height: h = 4 + 10\u00d72 - 2.5\u00d7(2)\u00b2, leading to h = 4 + 20 - 10 = 14. Therefore, the peak height attained is 14 meters at t = 2 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of determining the maximum height of a parabolic function using derivatives, specifically identifying the critical point where the slope of the function equals zero.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain how the height of an object launched into the sky changes over time, highlighting the relationship between the function's slope, its derivative, and the critical point of maximum height. The visualization should include a graph depicting the parabolic equation \\(h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2\\) with the curve showing the trajectory of the object, the tangent line illustrating the slope, and a marker indicating the critical point at \\(t = 2\\) seconds where the height reaches its maximum of 14 meters. Additionally, provide annotations to clarify how the derivative \\(h' = 10 - 5t\\) equals zero at this point, signifying a transition from increasing height to decreasing height. \n\nThe goal is to help learners visualize the relationship between the original function and its derivative, thereby deepening their understanding of critical and inflection points in calculus. By integrating a parabolic graph alongside the derivative curve and critical point indicators, the viewer can clearly see how changes in slope affect the height of the object over time, reinforcing the concept of maxima and minima in mathematical functions. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and interpret critical points and their significance in determining maxima and minima of functions, enhancing their grasp of how derivatives inform us about the behavior and characteristics of quadratic functions.",
