    "data": "Consider a scenario where an object is launched upward into the sky. The height of the object at any moment, t, can be represented by the equation: h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t\u00b2. To determine its peak height, we can utilize derivatives to compute the function's slope. The derivative of height with respect to time is: h' = 0 + 10 - 5t, simplifying to h' = 10 - 5t. Next, we set the slope equal to zero to find the time when the height reaches its maximum: 10 - 5t = 0, which simplifies to 5t = 10, thus t = 10 / 5 = 2 seconds. Hence, we know that the slope equals zero at t = 2 seconds. At this instant, we can calculate the corresponding height: h = 4 + 10\u00d72 - 2.5\u00d7(2)\u00b2, leading to h = 4 + 20 - 10 = 14. Therefore, the peak height attained is 14 meters at t = 2 seconds.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The concept of determining the peak height of a projectile by analyzing the derivative of its height function, specifically identifying critical (maximum) points where the function's slope is zero.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain how the peak height of a projectile can be determined using calculus, specifically through the analysis of its height function's derivative. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate the relationship between the height equation, its derivative, and the identification of the time at which the maximum height is attained. Key educational outcomes include an understanding of how to set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points and the relationship between the height and time variables.\n\nThe visualization should include a graph depicting the height function \\( h = 4 + 10t - 2.5t^2 \\), with its derivative \\( h' = 10 - 5t \\) plotted alongside, highlighting the point where the slope equals zero. A carousel or animated visual could effectively show the upward trajectory of the object, reaching its maximum height at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds and subsequently descending. By utilizing clear labels, colors, and annotations, the visual will enhance comprehension of how derivatives inform us about critical points in motion, thus fostering a deeper understanding of maxima and minima in mathematical functions.\n\n**Objective**: The objective is to enable learners to critically analyze and graphically interpret the relationship between a function and its derivative, leading to an understanding of how to locate critical points and the significance of these points in real-world scenarios such as projectile motion.",
