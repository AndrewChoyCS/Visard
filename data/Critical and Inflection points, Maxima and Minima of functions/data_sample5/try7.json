    "data": "The inflection points of a function are identified by the x-coordinates where the second derivative equals zero or becomes undefined, accompanied by a change in concavity of the function. A change in concavity can be observed when there is a sign shift in the second derivative. In this case, point 1 and point 2 serve as inflection points because the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and it alters its sign:  \n- At point 1, the second derivative transitions from negative to positive, indicating that the function's concavity shifts from concave down to concave up.  \n- At point 2, the sign of the second derivative reaches from positive to negative slanting from concave up to concave down.  \n- In contrast, at the point where the second derivative is undefined, it does not qualify as an inflection point since the sign remains unchanged, indicative that it maintains a concave up shape.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Inflection points of a function occur at positions where the second derivative equals zero or becomes undefined, leading to a change in the concavity of the function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in relation to the second derivative of a function. This visualization should illustrate how the second derivative's sign changes at different x-coordinates, specifically focusing on points where it equals zero and points where it is undefined. The visualization could take the form of a multi-layered diagram that integrates graphs showing the function and its second derivative, highlighting the transition of concavity at the identified inflection points. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the second derivative and the concavity changes of the function at these critical points. The key educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deep understanding of recognizing inflection points through sign shifts in the second derivative and differentiating between points of inflection and non-inflection points. By effectively connecting these mathematical concepts, the visual will enhance the learner's comprehension of the relationship between the first and second derivatives, facilitating their mastery of critical points, maxima, and minima in function analysis.",
