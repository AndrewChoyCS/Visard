    "data": "The inflection points of a function are identified by the x-coordinates where the second derivative equals zero or becomes undefined, accompanied by a change in concavity of the function. A change in concavity can be observed when there is a sign shift in the second derivative. In this case, point 1 and point 2 serve as inflection points because the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and it alters its sign:  \n- At point 1, the second derivative transitions from negative to positive, indicating that the function's concavity shifts from concave down to concave up.  \n- At point 2, the sign of the second derivative reaches from positive to negative slanting from concave up to concave down.  \n- In contrast, at the point where the second derivative is undefined, it does not qualify as an inflection point since the sign remains unchanged, indicative that it maintains a concave up shape.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\n**Inflection Points and Changes in Concavity: Inflection points in a function occur where the second derivative equals zero or is undefined, and there is a corresponding change in the concavity of the function.**\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points and changes in concavity in relation to the second derivative of a function.** The goal is to depict the behavior of the second derivative at various points on the function's graph, highlighting where it equals zero or is undefined while clearly marking the concavity transitions. The visualization should utilize a combination of graphs and labeled curves to illustrate the shifts from concave up to concave down (and vice versa) for points 1 and 2. \n\nThe specific aspects to visualize include the relationships between the second derivative, its sign, and the resulting concavity of the function. A mixed diagram style combining line graphs and annotations can clarify the cause-effect relationship between the second derivative's value and the function's concavity. This visual aid will deepen understanding by making the connection between mathematical concepts and their graphical representations clear and intuitive.\n\n### Educational Outcomes\nThrough this visualization, learners will be able to identify inflection points, understand the significance of changes in the second derivative, and explain how these points relate to the overall structure of the function. By focusing on these relationships, students will gain a comprehensive and nuanced grasp of critical points, maxima, and minima in calculus.",
