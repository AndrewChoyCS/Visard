    "data": "The inflection points of a function are identified by the x-coordinates where the second derivative equals zero or becomes undefined, accompanied by a change in concavity of the function. A change in concavity can be observed when there is a sign shift in the second derivative. In this case, point 1 and point 2 serve as inflection points because the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and it alters its sign:  \n- At point 1, the second derivative transitions from negative to positive, indicating that the function's concavity shifts from concave down to concave up.  \n- At point 2, the sign of the second derivative reaches from positive to negative slanting from concave up to concave down.  \n- In contrast, at the point where the second derivative is undefined, it does not qualify as an inflection point since the sign remains unchanged, indicative that it maintains a concave up shape.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Inflection points occur at x-coordinates where the second derivative is either zero or undefined and shows a change in concavity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in relation to the second derivative of a function. The goal is to illustrate how inflection points are characterized by the second derivative transitioning from positive to negative or vice versa, along with the corresponding shifts in concavity of the function. \n\nThe visualization should include two graphs: one depicting the function and its first derivative, and another showing the second derivative across a range of x-values. Use color coding to highlight the regions where the second derivative changes sign (concave up vs. concave down). \n\nThis specific representation aims to clarify the relationship between the second derivative and concavity changes, making it easier for learners to identify inflection points visually. By employing a clear, engaging infographic style, the visualization will reinforce critical educational outcomes, including the ability to derive the relationship between the derivatives and understand how changes in concavity impact the behavior of the original function. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and analyze inflection points on a curve by interpreting changes in the second derivative and understanding the implications of concavity in function behavior.",
