    "data": "The inflection points of a function are identified by the x-coordinates where the second derivative equals zero or becomes undefined, accompanied by a change in concavity of the function. A change in concavity can be observed when there is a sign shift in the second derivative. In this case, point 1 and point 2 serve as inflection points because the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined at those x-values, and it alters its sign:  \n- At point 1, the second derivative transitions from negative to positive, indicating that the function's concavity shifts from concave down to concave up.  \n- At point 2, the sign of the second derivative reaches from positive to negative slanting from concave up to concave down.  \n- In contrast, at the point where the second derivative is undefined, it does not qualify as an inflection point since the sign remains unchanged, indicative that it maintains a concave up shape.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** Inflection points of a function are the x-coordinates where the second derivative either equals zero or is undefined, accompanied by a change in concavity, which is indicated by a sign shift in the second derivative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of inflection points in relation to the second derivative of a function. The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate how changes in the sign of the second derivative correspond to shifts in concavity, highlighting the specific regions of a function where inflection points occur. This should include two distinct graphs showing the transitions at point 1 and point 2, where the concavity shifts occur, as well as an additional marker for a point where the second derivative is undefined and does not signify an inflection point.\n\nThe visualization should utilize clear labels, arrows to indicate transitions, and color coding to differentiate between concave up and concave down sections. Incorporating an infographic style will offer a visually engaging way to compare the behavior of the second derivative across different intervals, thus enhancing the student's comprehension of critical points, maxima, and minima. The expected educational outcome is a deep understanding of the relationship between the second derivative and concavity, enabling learners to identify inflection points in a function confidently.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to accurately identify and analyze inflection points of a function through the relationship between the second derivative and concavity, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of functions at critical points.",
