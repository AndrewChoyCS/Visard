    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The determination of the maximum height of a function using derivatives, and the relationships between its critical points, slopes, and height values.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of finding the maximum height of a ball's trajectory using derivatives. The visualization should depict the parabolic height function, h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2, alongside its derivative, h' = 20 \u2212 20t. Highlight the moment the derivative equals zero, indicating a critical point, and visually calculate the height at that point. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the function's slope, its maximum point, and the height reached at that maximum. Use a combination of a graph showing the height function and the derivative, with annotations indicating the critical point and calculated maximum height. Incorporate arrows and labels to emphasize the cause-effect relationships between the derivative and its zero slope, guiding learners through the process step-by-step. \n\nThis visualization should support learners in grasping the concept of maxima and minima in functions, and the importance of critical points in understanding the behavior of parabolic trajectories. The objective is to ensure learners can independently identify and interpret critical points in similar functions, reinforcing their understanding of calculus concepts in practical scenarios.",
