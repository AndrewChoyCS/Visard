    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** Understanding the relationship between the height of a projectile over time, derivatives of the height function, and identifying maxima through critical points.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of determining the maximum height of a projectile using its height function and derivatives. The goal is to illustrate the parabolic trajectory of the ball as described by the function \\( h = 5 + 20t - 10t^2 \\), highlighting how to find critical points where the derivative equals zero, indicating the maximum height. The visualization should depict the curve of the function, annotate the critical point at \\( t = 1 \\) second, and show the calculated maximum height of 15 meters. \n\nIncorporate styles such as a dynamic graph with labeled axes, clearly indicating height on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. Additionally, use color coding to differentiate the function, its derivative, and highlight the critical point. This visual will aid in understanding the relationship between the height function and its derivative, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship inherent in determining maxima and minima of functions. \n\n**Objective:** To deepen students' understanding of how to analyze polynomial functions for critical points and maxima by visually representing the parabolic height function, its derivative, and the importance of these relationships in the context of projectile motion.",
