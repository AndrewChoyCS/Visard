    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of maxima and minima in functions, particularly identifying the maximum height achieved by a projectile using derivatives.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of determining the maximum height of a projectile based on its height function, h(t) = 5 + 20t - 10t\u00b2. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between the height of the ball over time and how calculus, specifically the derivative, is used to find the critical point where the height reaches its peak. This visualization should incorporate a graph showing the height function, the derivative function, and clearly indicate the point where the slope is zero (the maximum point). \n\nTo enhance understanding, include labels and annotations that explain key components, such as the significance of the derivative being zero and how it corresponds to the maximum height. The visual should also indicate the calculated height at this point, reinforcing the understanding of how derivatives help find maxima in functions. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep comprehension of maxima and minima, an appreciation of the relationship between a function and its derivative, and the ability to visualize the process leading to finding critical points in a quadratic function. By illustrating this process, learners will grasp how calculus applies to real-world scenarios like projectile motion.",
