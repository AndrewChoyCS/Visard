    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between a quadratic function's height, its derivatives, and the identification of critical points to determine maxima.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between the height of a projectile (represented by the quadratic function \\( h = 5 + 20t - 10t^2 \\)), its derivative to find critical points, and the peak height achieved. The goal is to clarify how the function\u2019s slope changes over time, demonstrating where it equals zero, thus identifying the maximum height of the projectile. This visualization should illustrate the height function curve alongside its derivative, highlighting the point where the slope is zero, and marking the maximum height reached. \n\nSuggested visualization styles include an infographic that integrates a graph of the height equation with a separate graph of the derivative. Use clear labels to indicate key points, such as the critical point at \\( t = 1 \\) second and the maximum height of 15 meters. This visual will aid in understanding the sequential relationship between the quadratic function, its derivative, and how these elements work together to identify maxima, reinforcing the concept of critical points in calculus. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how to analyze quadratic functions using derivatives to determine maximum heights, recognizing the significance of critical points in the context of projectile motion. This will enhance their ability to visualize and interpret mathematical functions graphically.",
