    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Understanding the relationship between a function's derivative and identifying its maximum point, specifically in the context of projectile motion.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how to determine the maximum height of a projectile using derivatives. The visualization should illustrate the height function h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2 and its derivative h' = 20 \u2212 20t to highlight the relationship between the slope of the function and the point of maximum height. This visual will include a graph of the height function demonstrating the upward trajectory of the ball and a marked point where the derivative equals zero, signifying the maximum height at t = 1 second and h = 15 m. \n\nThe visualization should adopt a clear and informative style, such as a line graph combined with labeled points and annotations that guide the viewer through the process of finding critical points. This will reinforce understanding of cause-effect relationships in derivatives, enhance the recognition of maximum and minimum points of functions, and integrate instructional design principles such as sequential processes and comparative analysis.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of how derivatives reveal critical points in a function, specifically in identifying maxima and minima in the context of kinetic motion, enabling learners to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios effectively.",
