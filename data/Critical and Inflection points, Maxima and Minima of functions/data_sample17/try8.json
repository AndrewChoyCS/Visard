    "data": "Consider a scenario where a ball is propelled upwards. The expression for its height at any moment t is formulated as: h = 5 + 20t \u2212 10t\u00b2. To determine the highest point the ball reaches, we can use derivatives to analyze the slope of the function: h' = 0 + 20 \u2212 20t. We need to find when this slope equals zero: 20 \u2212 20t = 0 leads to 20t = 20, thus t = 20 / 20, giving us t = 1 second. At this particular moment, we can compute the height: h = 5 + 20\u00d71 \u2212 10\u00d71\u00b2 results in h = 5 + 20 \u2212 10 = 15. Therefore, the peak height achieved is 15 m (occurring at t = 1 s).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The peak height of an object projected upwards can be determined using derivatives from its height function, which involves analyzing the critical points of that function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of finding the maximum height of a projectile by analyzing its height function using derivatives. The visual should illustrate the quadratic function \\( h(t) = 5 + 20t - 10t\u00b2 \\) and its derivative \\( h'(t) = 20 - 20t \\). It should highlight the critical point where the slope (derivative) equals zero, showing the relationship between time \\( t \\) and height \\( h \\), along with calculating the peak height at this critical point.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a graphical plot of the height function over time, with marked critical points, arrows indicating the slope, and labeled coordinates to clarify the maximum height achieved. This will help learners understand the process of finding maxima in functions, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between the derivative, critical points, and function values. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Understand how to identify critical points in a quadratic function to determine maxima and minima, reinforcing the concept of using derivatives to analyze motion.",
