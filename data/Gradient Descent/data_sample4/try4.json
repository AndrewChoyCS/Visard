    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process and significance of the learning rate in the Gradient Descent Algorithm.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the learning rate (\u03b7) impacts the step size and convergence behavior of the algorithm. It should illustrate the relationship between the starting point, the gradient calculation, and the subsequent steps taken in the opposite direction of the gradient, emphasizing how different learning rates\u2014small vs. large\u2014affect convergence to the optimal solution. \n\nAn effective style for this visualization could be a flowchart combined with diagrams that represent each step in the process (initialization, gradient calculation, step size adjustment) alongside visual comparisons of convergence pathways for various learning rates (e.g., smaller learning rate leading to a gradual, smooth path down a function and larger learning rates causing erratic jumps). This visual approach aids understanding by highlighting the cause-effect relationships between the learning rate and convergence stability, making it clear how different strategies influence the algorithm's performance.\n\n**Objective**: Ensure a deep and crucial understanding of the Gradient Descent Algorithm\u2019s iterative nature, particularly how the learning rate affects stability and convergence, enabling learners to make informed choices about hyperparameter tuning in machine learning applications.",
