    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe iterative process of optimizing coefficients in the context of the cost function and the concept of reaching the minimum cost in Gradient Descent.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent using the metaphor of a bowl representing the cost function. The goal is to visually depict the bowl's surface, highlighting a random position indicating the current cost, and the process of exploring different coefficients to gradually reach the bowl's bottom\u2014the optimal point of minimum cost. This visualization should clarify the sequence of movements and decisions made to lower the cost, illustrating the cause-effect relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost evaluations. Suggested styles include a dynamic infographic showing movement through the bowl or a step-by-step diagram depicting each coefficient adjustment leading to decreasing costs.\n\n### Objective:\nLearners will deeply understand the iterative nature of Gradient Descent by recognizing how adjustments to coefficients impact cost, ultimately leading to the identification of optimal values. This understanding will empower learners to apply the concept in practical scenarios, reinforcing the relationship between exploration and optimization in machine learning contexts.",
