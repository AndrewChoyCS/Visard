    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of Gradient Descent, highlighting the relationship between the learning rate, the gradient, and the convergence behavior towards an optimal point.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, focusing on the relationships between the gradient, the learning rate, and the steps taken toward convergence. The visualization should clearly illustrate how smaller learning rates prolong convergence while larger rates may cause divergence or oscillation away from the optimal point. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a flowchart combined with graphs that depict the trajectory of the optimization process over iterations, allowing learners to see how each step moves in relation to the gradient and where it converges. Emphasizing this dynamic process will help deepen understanding of the factors affecting convergence and the outcomes of different learning rates.\n\n**Objective:** Ensure learners grasp the nuanced relationship between learning rate and convergence behavior in the Gradient Descent Algorithm, fostering an ability to choose appropriate learning rates based on the context of their machine learning tasks. This visual aid will enhance comprehension through clear representation of cause-effect relationships and the progression of the algorithm, aligning with instructional design best practices.",
