    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The iterative nature of the Gradient Descent algorithm, focusing on the role of the learning rate (\u03b7) in determining step size and convergence.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm, emphasizing the role of the learning rate (\u03b7) in controlling step size and its impact on convergence. The visualization should depict a graph showing a function error landscape with a clear goal of minimizing the function. Include multiple iterations, starting from an initial point, where arrows represent the direction and size of steps taken based on the calculated gradient. \n\nThe specific concept intended to be clarified is how varying the learning rate affects the convergence behavior of the algorithm\u2014demonstrating cases of optimal, too-small, and too-large learning rates. A flowchart format could be effective, where each step illustrates the calculation of the gradient, the scaled step in the opposite direction, and the new position, transitioning through examples of convergence and divergence. By illustrating relationships between step size, gradient behavior, and convergence outcomes, learners will gain a deep and nuanced understanding of how the learning rate influences the Gradient Descent process. \n\n**Objective:** To develop a crucial understanding of how the learning rate impacts the behavior of the Gradient Descent algorithm, particularly in terms of convergence speed and stability, enabling learners to make informed choices in practical applications.",
