    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of Gradient Descent, highlighting the importance of the learning rate and its impact on convergence behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent algorithm, focusing on how the learning rate affects the convergence towards the optimum point. The visualization should illustrate the process of choosing a starting point, calculating the gradient, making a step in the opposite direction, and the effect of varying learning rates on the convergence behavior. An interactive flowchart or a series of dynamic graphs would be ideal to demonstrate this principle. \n\nVisualizing the relationships between the learning rate, step size, and convergence paths will help clarify how to adjust parameters for optimal performance in machine learning models. The educational outcome should target a deep understanding of how different learning rates can lead to varied convergence speeds, which can either enhance or hinder the optimization process, ultimately fostering better decision-making in model training.\n\n**Objective:** Enhance learners' comprehension of the critical role that the learning rate plays in the Gradient Descent process, emphasizing the cause-effect relationships between learning rate values and convergence dynamics.",
