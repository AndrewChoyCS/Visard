    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of using Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting coefficients to find the minimum value is akin to navigating a bowl to reach its bottom.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of Gradient Descent as a process of navigating through a bowl-shaped cost function to find the minimum value. This visualization should illustrate the relationship between different coefficient values and their corresponding costs, depicting random positions on the surface of the bowl and how adjustments lead to lower costs. By highlighting the iterative nature of this process, the visual should guide learners to understand the cause-and-effect relationship between chosen coefficients and their cost outcomes. \n\nIncorporate styles such as a 3D representation of the bowl with dynamic arrows showing movements towards the minima, along with graphs plotting the cost values against iterations. This helps illustrate the sequential process of convergence and reinforces key educational outcomes, such as recognizing the iterative nature of optimization and the significance of reaching the minimum cost in predictive modeling.\n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of how Gradient Descent works by visualizing the impact of selecting different coefficients on minimizing the cost function, reinforcing the concepts of iteration, optimization, and decision-making in data-driven contexts.",
