    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size.

In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm, particularly the influence of the learning rate on convergence.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm, emphasizing the role of the learning rate (\u03b7) in scaling the steps taken towards minimization. The goal is to illustrate how smaller learning rates lead to more gradual convergence while larger rates can cause overshooting or divergence. This visualization should clarify the sequence of steps involved in the algorithm: initial point selection, gradient calculation, and scaled step movement, culminating in convergence towards an optimal point. A flowchart or infographic style could effectively highlight the relationships between each step and the impact of different learning rates on the path toward minimization.\n\n**Objective:** The visualization should foster a deep understanding of how the learning rate affects the convergence behavior of the Gradient Descent algorithm, helping learners grasp the significance of choosing an appropriate rate for effective optimization. By portraying the sequential process and showing comparative outcomes of varying learning rates, the visual will facilitate insights into the cause-and-effect relationships that govern the algorithm's performance, thereby enhancing instructional clarity.",
