    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: Gradient Descent and Locating the Minimum Cost**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of Gradient Descent using the analogy of a bowl representing a cost function. The visualization should illustrate how we start from various points on the surface of the bowl (representing different coefficient values and their associated costs), and how we iteratively select new coefficient values that lead us progressively closer to the minimum point at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThe visual should include a 3D representation of the bowl, marking different starting positions, the path taken towards the minimum, and the final output of coefficients that yield the lowest cost. Incorporate arrows or pathways that indicate the steps taken and highlight key points such as local minima and the optimal solution. Using a diagram will clarify the sequential process and relationships between the various coefficient values and their costs over iterations.\n\nThis visualization aims to deepen learners\u2019 understanding of how Gradient Descent progressively leads to the optimal solution while illustrating the cause-and-effect relationship between changes in coefficients and their corresponding costs.\n\n**Objective:**  \nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will achieve a comprehensive grasp of the Gradient Descent algorithm, enabling them to recognize the iterative nature of the process, understand how different coefficients influence costs, and appreciate the ultimate objective of minimizing the cost function effectively.",
