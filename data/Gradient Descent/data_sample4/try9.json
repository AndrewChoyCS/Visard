    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of Gradient Descent, specifically how the learning rate (\u03b7) influences step size, convergence speed, and the balance between minimizing the function and potential divergences.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent, focusing on how the learning rate (\u03b7) affects the step size and convergence behavior. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationship between the learning rate and the efficacy of reaching an optimal point in minimization. Key educational outcomes include the understanding of how different learning rates can lead to either efficient convergence or erratic movement around the optimal point. \n\nThis visualization should employ a flowchart style integrated with graphs that show trajectory paths for low, optimal, and high learning rates. Additionally, it should highlight cause-effect relationships by visually representing the impact of changing the learning rate on convergence speed and stability. By doing so, learners will develop a profound understanding of how the choice of learning rate directly affects the performance and stability of the Gradient Descent algorithm. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of how the learning rate influences the optimization process in Gradient Descent, enabling learners to make informed choices about parameter settings in machine learning contexts.",
