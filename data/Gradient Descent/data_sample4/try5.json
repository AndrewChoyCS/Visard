    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of finding the minimum cost in gradient descent can be visualized as navigating a surface shaped like a bowl, where the aim is to continually seek lower costs represented by different positions on the surface.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative process of finding the minimum cost in a bowl-like surface representing a cost function. The visualization should clearly depict a 3D model of a bowl, illustrating various paths taken to explore different positions on the surface, with markers showing current coefficients and their respective costs. This representation should highlight the movement toward the bowl's bottom, symbolizing the pursuit of the lowest cost. Incorporate arrows to indicate successive iterations of selecting coefficients and outline the progress toward the minimum. Utilizing a 3D diagram will effectively illustrate the relationships between the cost function and the coefficient values, enabling learners to grasp the process and significance of convergence more intuitively.\n\n**Objective**: The goal is to ensure learners comprehend the iterative nature of gradient descent, understanding how small adjustments to coefficients can lead to progressively lower costs, thereby solidifying knowledge of optimization methods in machine learning.",
