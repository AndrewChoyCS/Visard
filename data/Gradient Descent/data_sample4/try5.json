    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size.

In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, emphasizing the relationship between the learning rate (\u03b7), the gradient calculation, and the optimization path.**\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify how the algorithm adjusts its position based on the gradient at each step, and how the learning rate influences the size of these adjustments. Specifically, it should illustrate the balance between a small learning rate resulting in gradual convergence versus a large learning rate that may cause erratic movement or divergence. The visualization could take the form of a flowchart combined with a dynamic graph, showing the progression of points over time, with annotations for key steps: initialization, gradient calculation, and position update. \n\nThis visual aid will enhance understanding by clearly depicting the cause-effect relationship between the learning rate, the gradient, and the resulting trajectory toward the minimum. By representing these relationships visually, learners will better grasp the critical dynamics of the Gradient Descent process, leading to improved retention and application of this foundational machine learning concept.\n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of the iterative nature of Gradient Descent, emphasizing how the learning rate directly affects convergence behavior and optimization success.",
