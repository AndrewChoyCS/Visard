    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The impact of the learning rate (\u03b7) on the convergence behavior of the Gradient Descent algorithm.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain how the learning rate (\u03b7) affects the convergence behavior of the Gradient Descent algorithm. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationships between different learning rates (small, optimal, and large) and their effects on the path taken towards the minimum point in the function. This will include comparative graphs showing the convergence speed and stability for each learning rate scenario. \n\nThe visualization should consist of a series of line plots or animated graphs that depict the iterative steps of the algorithm, highlighting how smaller learning rates result in more gradual approaches to the minimum (potentially taking longer), while larger learning rates may lead to overshooting (oscillation) or divergence. By contrasting these behaviors, learners will gain a profound understanding of how selecting the right learning rate is crucial for the efficiency and accuracy of the optimization process.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to cultivate a deep and crucial understanding of how the learning rate influences convergence in Gradient Descent, enabling learners to make informed decisions about parameter tuning in machine learning models.",
