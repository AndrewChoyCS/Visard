    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of adjusting coefficients in Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function can be visualized effectively through a metaphor of a bowl, where the objective is to reach the lowest point.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of Gradient Descent using a large bowl graph. The goal is to visually represent the cost function as a bowl-shaped curve, where different positions on the surface indicate the current coefficients' costs. The visualization should illustrate the iterative process of moving towards the bottom of the bowl, which signifies minimizing the cost. Use arrows to show movement along the surface towards lower cost values, along with markers that indicate the starting point, interim steps, and the minimum cost position. This diagram will help learners understand the relationships between the coefficients\u2019 values, the resulting costs, and the sequential efforts involved in reaching optimal coefficients. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will be able to deeply understand the iterative nature of optimization in Gradient Descent, visualize the cause-effect relationship of adjusting coefficients on cost, and appreciate the sequential progression towards achieving the minimum cost. This understanding will be enhanced using a dynamic infographic style that emphasizes this iterative process and visualizes key transitions in the cost landscape, ultimately fostering proficiency in the application of the Gradient Descent algorithm.",
