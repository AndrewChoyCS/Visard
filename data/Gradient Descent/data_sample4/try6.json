    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the process of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, particularly focusing on the impact of learning rate on convergence.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the learning rate (\u03b7) influences the step size in the gradient descent method and its effect on finding the minimum of a function. It should illustrate the sequence of steps involved in gradient descent, from initialization through to convergence or divergence, depending on the selected learning rate. \n\nThe visualization could use an infographic style that includes plots showing different paths taken by the algorithm with varying learning rates\u2014one being too small, causing slow convergence, and another being too large, causing divergence or oscillation. This will enable learners to visually grasp the cause-effect relationship between learning rate and convergence behavior, enhancing their understanding of optimal parameter selection in machine learning algorithms. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep and thorough understanding of how varying the learning rate affects the efficiency and accuracy of the gradient descent optimization process, enabling learners to apply this knowledge in practical machine learning scenarios.",
