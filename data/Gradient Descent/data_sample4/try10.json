    "data": "Gradient Descent Algorithm Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n) There\u2019s an important parameter \u03b7 which scales the gradient and thus controls the step size. In machine learning, it is called learning rate and have a strong influence on performance. The smaller learning rate the longer GD converges, or may reach maximum iteration before reaching the optimum point If learning rate is too big the algorithm may not converge to the optimal point (jump around) or even to diverge completely. In summary, Gradient Descent method\u2019s steps are: 1-choose a starting point (initialisation), 2-calculate gradient at this point, 3-make a scaled step in the opposite direction to the gradient (objective: minimise), 4-repeat points 2 and 3 until one of the criteria is met: maximum number of iterations reached step size is smaller than the tolerance (due to scaling or a small gradient).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of the learning rate (\u03b7) in the Gradient Descent algorithm and its impact on convergence.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how different values of the learning rate influence the step size taken during the gradient descent process and consequently affect the convergence to the optimal point. Specifically, the visual should depict scenarios with three distinct learning rates: a small rate leading to slow convergence, an optimal rate achieving steady convergence, and a large rate causing divergence or oscillation away from the optimal point.\n\nThis visualization could take the form of a series of graphs illustrating each scenario, with clear labels indicating the learning rate values, step sizes, and progress towards the minimum function value. Additionally, arrows and annotations can be used to highlight the cause-and-effect relationship between the learning rate and the algorithm's path toward convergence or divergence. Integrating these best practices in instructional design will deepen learners' insight by clearly showing not only the sequential process of gradient descent but also comparative analysis of the effects of varying learning rates.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of how the learning rate influences the efficiency and effectiveness of the Gradient Descent algorithm, enabling learners to make informed decisions about parameter tuning in machine learning applications.",
