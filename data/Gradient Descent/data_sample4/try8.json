    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, with a specific focus on how the learning rate (\u03b7) influences the step size and convergence towards the optimal point.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate the sequential steps of the algorithm: starting from an initial point, calculating the gradient, and taking scaled steps in the opposite direction based on the learning rate. Use a line graph that shows the trajectory of multiple iterations, highlighting various step sizes for different values of the learning rate. Additionally, integrate a visual representation contrasting \u2018convergence\u2019 versus \u2018divergence\u2019 scenarios based on the learning rate\u2014using arrows to indicate direction and point convergence for appropriate learning rates, versus erratic movement for overly large learning rates.\n\nThe visualization should clearly convey the relationships between the learning rate, the gradient, and the resulting position, emphasizing how a well-chosen learning rate can help in reducing the function optimally, whereas an inappropriate rate can lead to overshooting or getting stuck. Utilize colors and labels effectively to clarify these dynamics and reinforce the flow of the process. This visual will deepen understanding by demonstrating cause-effect relationships within the iterative nature of the algorithm, ensuring learners grasp both the mechanics and implications of different learning rates in the context of optimization.\n\n### Objective:\nTo achieve a deep and crucial understanding of how the selection of the learning rate (\u03b7) directly affects the performance and outcome of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, thereby enabling learners to effectively apply this knowledge in practical machine learning problems.",
