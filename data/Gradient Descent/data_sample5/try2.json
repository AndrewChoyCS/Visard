    "data": "Gradient descent is an optimization technique used primarily for unconstrained problems. This first-order iterative method aims to minimize a multivariate function that is differentiable. The process involves repeatedly moving in the contrary direction of the gradient (or an estimated gradient) from the current point, since this leads to the steepest descent. In contrast, moving along the direction of the gradient will pursue the upward slope of the function, a practice known as gradient ascent. This method is especially beneficial in machine learning as it helps in reducing the cost or loss associated with a function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle**: The concept of optimizing a multivariate function through the iterative process of gradient descent, emphasizing the movement in the opposite direction of the gradient to achieve the steepest descent.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the process of gradient descent as an optimization technique. The goal of the visualization is to clarify the iterative nature of moving in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize a differentiable multivariate function. This visualization should illustrate the relationship between the current position, the gradient, and the new position after each iteration, highlighting the concept of steepest descent versus gradient ascent. \n\nTo effectively convey this concept, consider using a combination of a 3D graph and arrows to depict the geometry of the function's surface, showing both downward (gradient descent) and upward (gradient ascent) movements. Incorporate labeled steps to indicate how the search for the minimum position unfolds iteratively. This visual will aid students in understanding the dynamics and importance of directionality in optimization, promoting a deeper insight into why gradient descent is beneficial in machine learning.\n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will be able to articulate the iterative process of gradient descent, including how selecting the opposite direction of the gradient facilitates the minimization of a multivariate function, and connect this understanding to its application in machine learning for reducing cost or loss.",
