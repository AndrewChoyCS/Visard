    "data": "Gradient descent is an optimization technique used primarily for unconstrained problems. This first-order iterative method aims to minimize a multivariate function that is differentiable. The process involves repeatedly moving in the contrary direction of the gradient (or an estimated gradient) from the current point, since this leads to the steepest descent. In contrast, moving along the direction of the gradient will pursue the upward slope of the function, a practice known as gradient ascent. This method is especially beneficial in machine learning as it helps in reducing the cost or loss associated with a function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The process of gradient descent as an iterative method to minimize a multivariate differentiable function by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of gradient descent in relation to its iterative nature and the relationship with the gradient of a function. The visualization should illustrate the gradient of a multivariate function in a 3D space, showing how points move iteratively towards the minimum by following the steepest descent path. Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of the directional movement in relation to the gradient, the difference between gradient descent and gradient ascent, and the implications for optimization in machine learning.\n\nThe visualization could utilize a 3D surface plot combined with animated arrows to indicate movement from one iteration to the next, effectively depicting the cause-and-effect relationship between the gradient direction and the optimization process. This helps learners grasp the concept of navigating the function space and the sequential nature of the iterations in finding the minimum. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve deep comprehension of the iterative process of gradient descent, enabling learners to visualize how movement along the gradient impacts the optimization of differentiable functions and understand its critical role in machine learning applications.",
