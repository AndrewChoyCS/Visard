    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent and how it navigates the function's landscape to converge on the minimum.** This visualization should include a graph of a generic function along with its derivative, highlighting the relationship between the value of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), the function value, and the derivative at various points. Key educational outcomes include understanding how gradient descent adjusts the parameter based on the sign of the derivative, thus indicating whether to move right or left on the graph to find the minimum. \n\nThe visualization should function like a flowchart, illustrating the sequential decision-making process at key points\u2014where the guesses are low, where they are high, and how the derivative guides movement towards the optimal \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). This stylistic choice enhances understanding by clearly showing cause-and-effect relationships in the iterative adjustment of \\(\\theta\\), and it helps learners visually grasp the dynamics of optimization in non-linear contexts. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of how gradient descent operates as an iterative optimization algorithm, emphasizing the importance of derivatives in guiding parameter adjustments toward minimizing a loss function.",
