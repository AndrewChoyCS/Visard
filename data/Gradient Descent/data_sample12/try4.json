    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in minimizing a loss function.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how gradient descent adjusts an estimate of the parameter \\(\\theta\\) based on the gradient (derivative) of the loss function at each step. It should clarify the relationship between the position of \\(\\theta\\), the sign of the derivative, and the impact this has on convergence towards the minimum point of the function. \n\nThe visual could incorporate a graph showing the loss function overlaid with its derivative, highlighting critical points where the derivative equals zero, and marking the iterations of \\(\\theta\\) as it adjusts left or right based on whether the derivative is negative or positive. Using a flowchart style can help highlight the cause-effect relationships inherent in this iterative adjustment process.\n\nBy understanding this visualization, learners should achieve the educational outcomes of comprehending the mechanics of gradient descent, recognizing the significance of the derivative in optimization, and grasping how to effectively navigate complex loss landscapes to find minimal values. This deep understanding emphasizes the sequential adjustments that lead to convergence in optimization tasks.",
