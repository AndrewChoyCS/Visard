    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Iterative Adjustment Process in Gradient Descent**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative adjustment process in gradient descent, illustrating how the parameter $\\theta$ is adjusted based on the sign of the derivative of the loss function. The visualization should depict two primary scenarios: when the guess for $\\theta$ is too low (resulting in a negative derivative) and when it is too high (leading to a positive derivative). The goal is to clarify the cause-and-effect relationships between the position of $\\theta$, the value of the derivative, and the subsequent adjustments made to find the optimal minimum.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of an infographic that features graphs of the loss function alongside arrows indicating movement along the x-axis (value of $\\theta$) in response to the derivative's sign. Key educational outcomes should include a deep understanding of how the gradient guides the adjustment process and the intuitive grasp of reaching the optimal point through iterative updates.\n\nBy focusing on the dynamic relationship between the guess, the derivative, and the corresponding actions taken, this visual will aid learners in conceptualizing how gradient descent methodically hones in on the minimum, providing clarity on this essential optimization technique.",
