    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of gradient descent, which adjusts the parameter $\\theta$ based on the derivative of the loss function, helps find the minimum value without full visibility of the cost function\u2019s range.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in finding the optimal parameter $\\theta$ that minimizes a loss function, particularly when the cost function is not fully visible. The goal is to illustrate how adjustments to $\\theta$ are guided by the sign of the derivative, showing the systematic approach of increasing or decreasing $\\theta$ to converge towards the true minimum. This visualization should use a line graph to display the function alongside its derivative, with clearly marked points indicating where the derivative is zero and highlighting the adjustments made to $\\theta$ based on whether the current estimate is low or high. \n\nThe visual aids in understanding the cause-effect relationship between the derivative\u2019s sign and the adjustment of $\\theta$, emphasizing how this iterative method effectively narrows down to the optimal solution. A flowchart alongside the graph can illustrate the decision-making process in adjusting $\\theta$. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners should be able to demonstrate a deep understanding of the gradient descent algorithm, specifically explaining how changes to the parameter $\\theta$ based on derivative sign lead to convergence towards the minimum loss, fostering insights into numerical optimization techniques used in more complex models.",
