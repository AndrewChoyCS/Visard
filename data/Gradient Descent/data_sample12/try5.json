    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative approach to minimize a loss function when conventional methods fall short.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate the process of adjusting parameter values in gradient descent to converge on the optimum solution. Specifically, it should clarify how the derivative provides crucial feedback on whether to increase or decrease the parameter \\(\\theta\\) based on whether an initial guess is too low or too high. A line graph depicting the generic function alongside its derivative will help visualize the critical points where the derivative equals zero and indicate the direction of adjustment based on the sign of the derivative. \n\nThis approach adheres to best practices in instructional design by highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship between the position of \\(\\theta\\) and the behavior of the derivative, thus allowing learners to understand the sequential process of iterative approximation. The visualization will deepen understanding by clearly showing the adjustment process - increasing \\(\\theta\\) when below the minimum and decreasing when above, ultimately guiding learners toward a solid grasp of how iterative algorithms efficiently minimize complex loss functions in the absence of full visibility into the cost function's range.\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo achieve a deep understanding of gradient descent, students will elucidate how iterative adjustments based on derivative feedback can effectively minimize a complex loss function, leading to an appreciation of optimization strategies in machine learning contexts.",
