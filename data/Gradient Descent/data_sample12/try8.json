    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in finding the minimizing parameter, \u03b8.** This visualization should depict how the function\u2019s value changes based on different estimates of \u03b8 and illustrate how derivatives inform adjustments to these estimates. Focus on the graphical representation of the loss function alongside its derivative, highlighting critical points where the derivative equals zero and demonstrating adjustment pathways based on whether the current estimate is above or below the optimum.\n\nThe goal is to clarify the concept of optimization through gradient descent, emphasizing how to navigate the loss function's landscape, identify minima, and refine estimates iteratively. Using a line graph for the loss function and bar graphs or arrows for the derivative will effectively illustrate these relationships and processes. By visualizing these dynamic adjustments and their outcomes, learners will grasp not only how gradient descent operates but also the foundational principles of optimization in more complex scenarios. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Deepen understanding of how iterative adjustments in gradient descent lead to the identification of optimal parameter values, fostering a practical comprehension of function behavior and optimization strategy.
