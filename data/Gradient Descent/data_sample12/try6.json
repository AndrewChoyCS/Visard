    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative nature of gradient descent, illustrating how parameter adjustments converge to the optimal value through the analysis of derivatives.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent and how it converges to the minimizing parameter $\\theta$. This visualization should depict a graph of the arbitrary function alongside its derivative, highlighting how the derivative informs the direction and size of parameter adjustments in relation to the minimum point at $\\theta = 5.3$. The goal is to clarify the cause-and-effect relationship between the derivative's sign (positive or negative) and the subsequent movement of $\\theta$. \n\n**Visualization Style:** A multi-part graph combining line graphs for the function and its derivative, with arrows indicating movement direction based on derivative values. Include light green markers where the derivative equals zero, emphasizing critical points.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how gradient descent operates through visual representation of the iterative adjustments based on derivative analysis. This will clarify the relationships between guesses, derivatives, and minimization, reinforcing concepts of optimization in a clear and intuitive manner. The visualization will facilitate learning by making the abstract concept of gradient descent more accessible and relatable, thus enhancing comprehension of iterative optimization processes.",
