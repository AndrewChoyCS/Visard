    "goal": "**Core Principle for Visualization:** The iterative adjustment process in gradient descent, where the direction of adjustment is determined by the sign of the derivative, guiding the parameter estimation towards the optimal value.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent, illustrating how adjustments are made based on the sign of the derivative. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between the parameter value (theta), the derivative's value, and the adjustment direction. This should depict how, starting from an initial guess, the iterative process guides the parameter towards its minimum by showing areas where the derivative is negative (indicating an increase in theta) and positive (indicating a decrease in theta). \n\nA flowchart or diagram could effectively represent this process, highlighting the cause-effect relationships: how the derivative informs the direction of the adjustment and ultimately leads to convergence at the optimal value of theta. Additionally, it can incorporate a graph of the cost function with light green points where the derivative equals zero, indicating critical points. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of how the gradient descent algorithm navigates parameter space and the significance of the derivative in making informed adjustments, making the learner capable of applying these concepts to more complex models beyond simple calculus methods.",
