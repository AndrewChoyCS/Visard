    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the process of gradient descent in optimizing a loss function.** \n\nThe goal is to visually demonstrate how iterative adjustments can help approximate the minimizing parameter \\(\\theta\\) when the overall cost function is not fully visible. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the parameter values, the derivative of the loss function, and the adjustments needed to approach the optimal solution. Specifically, it should illustrate how moving left or right based on the sign of the derivative influences the position of \\(\\theta\\) over multiple iterations.\n\nA combination of a graph showing the loss function curve alongside the derivative curve can serve this purpose. Use arrows to indicate the direction of adjustment based on derivative sign (negative vs. positive) and highlight critical points where the derivative equals zero. Incorporating annotations and color coding will help emphasize cause-and-effect relationships, making the iterative process clearer.\n\n**Educational Objective:** \nStudents will achieve a deep understanding of the iterative nature of gradient descent and how it converges towards the minimum of complex loss functions, thereby grasping the underlying mechanics of optimization techniques in machine learning contexts. This visualization will enhance students\u2019 abilities to relate the mathematical concepts of derivatives to the practical algorithms used in model training.",
