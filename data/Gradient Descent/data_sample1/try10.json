    "data": "Gradient descent is a method for unconstrained mathematical optimization. It is a first-order iterative algorithm for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a trajectory that maximizes that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. It is particularly useful in machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The process of gradient descent as an iterative method for minimizing a function, specifically focusing on the concept of taking steps in the direction opposite to the gradient.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as a method for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the current position, the gradient direction, and the steps taken toward minimization. It should highlight the concept of steepest descent by showcasing a 2D contour plot of a function with arrows indicating both the gradient and the movement direction during iterations. An infographic style would be ideal, allowing for sequential representation of multiple iterations, including a comparison with gradient ascent. This will help learners grasp the cause-effect relationships of moving against the gradient to locate a minimum effectively.\n\n**Educational Outcomes**: Learners will be able to visually comprehend the iterative nature of gradient descent and gradient ascent, distinguish between the two processes, and understand how these methods are applied in optimization problems, particularly in machine learning contexts. Additionally, the visualization will facilitate a deeper understanding of how adjusting steps based on the gradient leads to convergence toward a minimum, reinforcing the impact of these iterative adjustments on the optimization process.",
