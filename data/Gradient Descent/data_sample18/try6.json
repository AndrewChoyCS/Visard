    "data": "The Gradient Descent Algorithm employs an iterative method to determine subsequent points by utilizing the gradient at the current location. It scales this gradient with a learning rate and subtracts the result from the current position. This subtraction is crucial to achieve minimization of the function; if the goal were maximization, addition would be applied. The mathematical formulation can be expressed as: p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n). A critical element in this process is the parameter \u03b7, which adjusts the size of the gradient step, and hence dictates the step size. Its importance becomes evident in machine learning, as it has significant effects on performance. A minimized learning rate results in a prolonged convergence of the Gradient Descent or could lead to hitting the maximum iteration limit prior to locating the optimal point. On the other hand, an excessively large learning rate may cause the algorithm to not only errantly fluctuate around the optimal solution but sometimes diverge too. To summarize, the steps of the Gradient Descent method consist of: 1. initializing a starting point, 2. calculating the corresponding gradient at that point, 3. taking a scaled step contrarily to the gradient (the aim being minimization), 4. repeating steps 2 and 3 until one of the stopping criteria is fulfilled: either the maximum iteration limit has been hit or the step size falls below a defined tolerance (which may be a result of scaling or a minor gradient).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the learning rate (\u03b7) and the behavior of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, specifically how it affects convergence and step size.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the impact of the learning rate (\u03b7) on the Gradient Descent Algorithm's convergence behavior. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how varying the learning rate can lead to different convergence outcomes\u2014successful minimization, slow convergence, or divergence. This visualization should focus on relationships by comparing small, optimal, and large learning rates, depicted through a series of graphs or illustrations that show the trajectory of the algorithm's steps towards the optimal point. \n\nConsider using a flowchart-like structure that represents each scenario clearly, with arrows indicating the direction of movement toward minimization, and accompanying graphs showing the changes in objective function values over iterations. By visually contrasting these paths, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how the size of the learning rate affects both step size and convergence effectiveness, highlighting the cause-effect relationship between learning rates and convergence outcomes.\n\n**Educational Objective:** To ensure learners can critically analyze how the choice of learning rate influences the trajectory of Gradient Descent, empowering them to make informed decisions when applying this optimization algorithm in machine learning scenarios.",
