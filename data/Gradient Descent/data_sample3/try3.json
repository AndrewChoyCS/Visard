    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of iteratively refining coefficients in Gradient Descent to minimize cost.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of Gradient Descent as a journey to the bottom of a bowl-shaped cost function. The goal is to illustrate how different sets of coefficient values correspond to varying costs represented on the surface of the bowl. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the current position on the bowl\u2019s surface (representing the cost of coefficients) and the ultimate goal of reaching the lowest point (minimum cost). \n\nUsing a 3D diagram of a bowl, include paths to show various trial coefficients and their associated costs, using arrows to indicate movement toward lower costs. Additionally, you may incorporate animations to simulate the descending motion towards the bowl's bottom, highlighting how each coefficient tweak leads to cost evaluation. This approach will facilitate a deep understanding of the iterative process, showcasing how small changes can lead to significant improvements.\n\n**Objective:** Students will grasp the core concept of iterative improvement in Gradient Descent, understanding how continuous evaluation and adjustment of coefficients lead to finding minimal cost in optimization problems. This objective includes recognizing relationships between coefficient adjustments and cost changes in a visual context.",
