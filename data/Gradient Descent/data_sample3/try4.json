    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of exploring different values of coefficients to minimize the cost function in Gradient Descent.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent as it relates to finding the minimum cost on the surface of a bowl-shaped cost function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how starting from a random position on the bowl's surface, different coefficient values are evaluated to achieve progressively lower costs. This should clarify the concept of moving towards the minimum cost by selecting better coefficients iteratively. \n\nThe visualization should employ a diagrammatic style that depicts the bowl-shaped cost function and highlight the step-by-step journey of coefficient values, marked by arrows pointing downwards toward the bowl's bottom (the optimal cost). Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of how the iterative updates relate to visual positions on the bowl, reinforcing the connection between trial and error in coefficient selection and the goal of minimizing cost. \n\nThis visual aids in understanding by effectively illustrating the cause-effect relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost changes while emphasizing the sequential nature of the process, enabling learners to grasp the underlying logic of Gradient Descent. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of how iterative adjustments in coefficients within the Gradient Descent algorithm systematically lead to minimizing the cost function, fostering an appreciation for the process's dynamic nature and its application in optimization problems.",
