    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of gradient descent, including the evaluation of cost, calculation of the derivative, and adjustment of coefficients based on the learning rate.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent, focusing on how coefficients are updated to minimize cost. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between initial coefficient values, cost evaluation, derivative calculation, and the update mechanism influenced by the learning rate. Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of how each step in the process affects the next and how the concept of \"downhill\" direction guides the iterative adjustments. \n\nThe visualization should utilize a flowchart combined with graphical representations of a cost curve, where the x-axis represents the coefficient values and the y-axis represents the cost. Each iteration can be depicted with arrows showing the movement of coefficients and corresponding cost changes, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship that leads to convergence towards a minimum cost. This design will clarify the sequence of actions in the gradient descent procedure and enable learners to visualize the dynamic process of optimization effectively. \n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand the iterative nature of the gradient descent procedure, emphasizing its components, sequential flow, and the relationships among the coefficients, cost, and learning rate that contribute to minimizing the overall cost.",
