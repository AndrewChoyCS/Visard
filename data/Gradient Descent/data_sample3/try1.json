    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe process of Gradient Descent as a method to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting coefficients based on their cost values.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of Gradient Descent as a process of navigating down the surface of a bowl to find the minimum cost. The visualization should depict a three-dimensional bowl representing the cost function, with arrows or markers indicating various points on the surface that represent different coefficient values and their associated costs. It should illustrate the iterative process of selecting new coefficients based on comparative costs, ultimately guiding the viewer toward the minimum point at the bottom of the bowl. The use of a diagram or animated infographic will clearly convey the relationships and sequences involved in this optimization process, helping learners grasp how small adjustments lead to progressively lower costs.\n\n### Learning Objective:\nThe objective is for learners to achieve a deep understanding of how Gradient Descent operates as an iterative optimization technique, recognizing the dynamic relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost reduction. By visualizing this process, learners will be able to articulate the cause-effect relationships inherent in Gradient Descent and appreciate the importance of each iteration in striving toward minimal cost effectively.",
