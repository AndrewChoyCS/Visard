    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe iterative process of optimizing coefficients in Gradient Descent, illustrated as navigating the surface of a curved cost function bowl toward its lowest point.\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent using a large bowl as a metaphor for the cost function.** The visualization should depict the bowl in three dimensions, with varying heights representing the cost for different coefficient values. Use arrows to indicate the path taken by an initial position toward the lowest point, showing multiple attempts to navigate downward as new coefficient values are evaluated. Include clear labels for the starting position, cost values at different coefficients, and the optimal coefficient values at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the concept of moving towards the minimum cost through iterative adjustments, highlighting the relationships between current coefficients and their associated costs, as well as the sequential nature of the optimization process. The expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of how Gradient Descent works, the significance of local minima, and the importance of evaluating multiple coefficient configurations.\n\nThis visualization should employ a 3D diagram style, showcasing the dynamic progression of cost evaluation and adjustment, which will help learners visualize and internalize the nuanced process of reaching the minimum cost effectively. Through this visual representation, students will develop a crucial understanding of how the optimization process continues until convergence at the lowest cost, thereby reinforcing the conceptual framework of Gradient Descent.",
