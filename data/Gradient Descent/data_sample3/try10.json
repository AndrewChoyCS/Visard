    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Iterative Update Process in Gradient Descent**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative update process in the Gradient Descent procedure. The visualization should depict the relationship between the coefficient values, cost evaluation, and the adjustment of coefficients based on the calculated derivative. Key elements should include the initial coefficient values, the cost curve, the slope (derivative), and how the coefficients are updated after each iteration. A flowchart or infographic style would effectively illustrate the sequence of steps and the continuous movement towards minimizing the cost. This visual should clarify how each adjustment is made based on the learning rate (alpha) and the direction of the slope, enhancing learner comprehension of the cyclical nature of this optimization technique.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will understand how the iterative update process in Gradient Descent enables optimization, focusing on the relationships between coefficient adjustments, cost evaluations, and derivatives, thus leading to a comprehensive grasp of how machine learning algorithms reduce error iteratively.",
