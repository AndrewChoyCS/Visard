    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of updating coefficients in Gradient Descent based on the evaluation of cost, its derivatives, and the learning rate.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Procedure. The visualization should depict the relationship between the initial coefficients, their associated costs, the calculated derivative (slope), and the effect of the learning rate on coefficient updates. It should incorporate multiple graphs or flow diagrams to illustrate how each iteration leads toward minimizing the cost function. Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of how coefficients are adjusted in search of the minimum cost, as well as the impact of the learning rate on this adjustment process. \n\nThe visualization could employ a series of line graphs to depict cost vs. coefficient values over multiple iterations, alongside a flowchart to represent the step-by-step process from initial values through cost evaluation, derivative calculation, and final updates. This design will not only clarify sequential processes but also highlight the cause-effect relationships between the derivative, cost, and coefficient values, thereby deepening learners' insight into the mechanics of Gradient Descent.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will be able to clearly articulate the iterative nature of Gradient Descent, understanding how coefficients adapt through a systematic evaluation of costs and their derivatives, enhancing their comprehension of optimization in machine learning contexts.",
