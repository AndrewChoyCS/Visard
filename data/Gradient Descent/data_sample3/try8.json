    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize: The Process of Gradient Descent as Navigating a Bowl to Find Minimum Cost**\n\n**Query:**  \nCreate a visualization to explain the process of Gradient Descent by illustrating how it is akin to navigating a bowl to find the minimum cost at the bottom. The visualization should depict a 3D model of a bowl representing the cost function, with varying positions representing different coefficients. Arrows should indicate movements toward lower costs, and points on the surface of the bowl should demonstrate various coefficient values and their corresponding costs. The visualization is intended to clarify the sequential process of adjusting coefficients to minimize cost, highlighting the iterative nature of Gradient Descent. By using styles like a 3D interactive diagram or animated infographic, learners will be able to visualize the relationships between coefficient adjustments, their costs, and the ultimate goal of finding the minimum cost. \n\n**Expected Educational Outcomes:**  \nLearners will gain a deep understanding of how Gradient Descent operates, recognize the importance of each adjustment in reducing cost, and appreciate the iterative nature of the process involved in achieving optimal coefficients.",
