    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of gradient descent can be visualized as navigating the surface of a bowl to arrive at the minimum cost, which represents the optimal values for the coefficients.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as navigating a bowl-shaped cost function. The visualization should depict the bowl with various heights representing costs at different coefficient values, highlighting key positions on the surface, including the starting point, intermediate positions, and the minimum point at the bottom. The goal is to clarify how each step involves evaluating and selecting new coefficient values based on cost comparisons, visually tracking the descent towards the minimum. Use a series of arrows to show movement and gradients, overlaying a dynamic path that indicates progressive changes in coefficients. This visual should be an infographic that emphasizes the relationships between positions on the bowl and corresponding costs while illustrating the sequential nature of the iterative process.\n\n---\n\n**Learning Objective:** Deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of gradient descent by visualizing how each iterative step leads closer to the minimum cost, allowing them to grasp the importance of evaluating different coefficients and the overall goal of minimizing the cost function. This understanding will support learners in effectively applying gradient descent in various optimization problems.",
