    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\n**The iterative process of updating coefficients through the gradient descent method, using the cost evaluation and derivative information to converge towards a minimum cost.**\n\n### Query for Visualization\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Procedure. This visual should illustrate how coefficients are updated over multiple iterations, highlighting the relationship between the cost function, its derivative (slope), and the effect of the learning rate (alpha) on these updates. The primary goal is to clarify how each iteration moves the coefficient values closer to minimizing the cost by visually displaying the cost curve, slopes at different points, and the directional updates of the coefficients. A series of graphs or an infographic can be used to show multiple iterations, the changing cost, and directional movement along the cost curve. \n\nThis visual aids in understanding the concept by depicting the causal relationships between cost evaluation, the steepness of the slope, and the adjustments made to the coefficients, thus offering a clear and comprehensive view of how optimization progresses. \n\n### Learning Objective\nStudents will develop a deep understanding of how the gradient descent algorithm works, gaining insights into the significance of the derivative in guiding coefficient updates, and the role of the learning rate in controlling the convergence process. This understanding will empower learners to analyze optimization techniques effectively and appreciate their relevance in machine learning contexts.",
