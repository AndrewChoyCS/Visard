    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of adjusting coefficients to minimize cost, represented by a gradient descent trajectory on a cost function surface, can be conceptualized as navigating a bowl where the goal is to reach the lowest point.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of gradient descent as a movement within a bowl-shaped cost function. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how various coefficients affect the position within the bowl and to demonstrate the process of moving toward the minimum cost at the bowl's bottom. This visualization should clarify the concept of cost minimization through sequential adjustments, depicting a series of points representing different coefficient values as they converge toward the optimal solution. A 3D graph of the bowl surface with arrows showing the gradient descent path as well as side charts breaking down the cost at each coefficient value will enhance the learner\u2019s understanding. The visual should highlight not just the trajectory but also the relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost reduction, ultimately reinforcing the educational outcome of grasping how iterative optimization leads to effective learning in machine learning scenarios.\n\n**Objective**: To foster a deep understanding of the iterative process of gradient descent, enabling learners to visualize and comprehend how adjustments in coefficients reduce cost and lead to optimal model performance in machine learning.",
