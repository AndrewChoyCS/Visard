    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of iteratively refining coefficients in Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function represented as a bowl shape.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent as a journey towards the bottom of a bowl-shaped cost function. The visualization should depict a large bowl where the surface represents various cost levels associated with different coefficients. Include markers to show the initial random position of coefficients, subsequent movements towards lower costs, and ultimately reaching the minimum. The key educational outcomes expected are to enhance the learner's understanding of how iterative adjustments lead to minimized costs and the importance of evaluating different coefficient values. Suggested visualization styles include an infographic or a step-by-step diagram that clearly illustrates the relationships and sequences involved in the process. This visual aid will clarify the cause-effect relationship between the movement along the bowl and the resulting changes in cost, thereby deepening comprehension of the Gradient Descent algorithm. \n\n**Objective:** To enable learners to grasp the iterative nature of Gradient Descent, understand how small adjustments to coefficients can lead to progressively lower costs, and visualize the path to the minimum of the cost function effectively.",
