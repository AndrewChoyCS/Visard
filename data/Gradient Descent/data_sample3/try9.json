    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of gradient descent involves evaluating the cost of coefficients, calculating the derivative to find the direction for adjustment, and updating coefficients using a learning rate until the cost approaches zero.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent Procedure. The visualization should illustrate how initial coefficient values impact the cost, how the derivative represents the slope of the function, and how coefficients are updated based on the learning rate. This should clarify the sequential relationship between evaluating cost, determining direction through the derivative, and adjusting coefficients. A flowchart or infographic style would effectively represent the procedural flow, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationships at each step of the iteration. This visual will deepen understanding by showing how adjustments lead to convergence towards minimal cost.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will deeply grasp the iterative nature of gradient descent, enabling them to articulate how each step affects the subsequent adjustment of coefficients and ultimately leads to minimizing the cost function effectively.",
