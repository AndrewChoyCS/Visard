    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe process of iteratively adjusting coefficients in Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function, represented as navigating a bowl towards its lowest point.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent using the analogy of navigating a bowl to find the minimum point. The visualization should depict a large, 3D bowl that represents the cost function, with a marker indicating the position of current coefficients on the surface of the bowl. As the viewer observes, there should be arrows leading to lower positions on the bowl\u2019s surface to represent attempts at finding better coefficients. The key educational outcome is to demonstrate how small changes in coefficient values can lead to progressively lower costs, visually illustrating the cause-effect relationship inherent in Gradient Descent.\n\nThe visualization should be a series of steps (like a flowchart) showing each iteration as a sequence of movements toward the bowl's lowest point. Including comparative elements, such as different starting positions, can further clarify how initial values impact the efficiency and path of convergence. This representation will deepen understanding of the Sequential Process of Gradient Descent, capturing both the essence of the optimization journey and the underlying mathematical principle of minimizing cost through iteration. \n\n**Objective:**\nTo foster a deep understanding of how iterative adjustments of coefficients in Gradient Descent function to efficiently navigate towards the minimum cost, emphasizing the relationship between the cost function's landscape and the optimization process.",
