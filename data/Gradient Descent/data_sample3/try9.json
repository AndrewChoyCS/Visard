    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the coefficient values and the cost function as represented by the shape of a bowl, illustrating the process of finding the minimum cost via iteration.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of Gradient Descent using the metaphor of a bowl. The visualization should depict a 3D representation of a bowl-like surface where the vertical axis represents cost and the horizontal axes represent different coefficient values. Showcase different positions on the surface indicating various costs associated with coefficient values, and highlight the iterative process of moving downward towards the bowl's minimum. Include arrows to illustrate the direction of movement in search of lower costs. This visualization will clarify how changes in coefficients impact the cost and emphasize the iterative nature of finding the minimum. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes are that learners will understand how to visualize the optimization process, identify relationships between coefficients and cost, and grasp the concept of approaching a minimum through successive trials. Using a 3D surface plot will deepen understanding of the dynamic process, making abstract concepts concrete and enhancing retention through visual learning principles. \n\n**Objective:** Ensure learners can articulate how Gradient Descent converges towards the minimum cost while recognizing the relationship between the coefficients and their corresponding cost, fostering a mastery of optimization techniques.",
