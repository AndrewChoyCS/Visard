    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Iterative Process of Gradient Descent and Its Dependence on the Derivative**\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent, illustrating how initial coefficient values are adjusted based on the derivative of cost. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between the coefficients, the computed cost, and the derivative that guides the updates of these coefficients. The intent is to depict this process as a sequential flowchart that shows each step\u2014from initializing the coefficients, calculating the cost, finding the derivative, determining the update direction, and applying the learning rate\u2014until the cost approaches zero. \n\nThe visual should effectively highlight the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements, enabling learners to grasp how each component contributes to the overall convergence towards minimal cost. By using clear labels, directional arrows, and potentially color-coding for positive and negative slopes, the comprehension of gradient descent and its iterative nature can be greatly enhanced.\n\n**Objective:** Understand the iterative nature of gradient descent and its reliance on the calculated derivative, enabling students to accurately describe the process of optimizing coefficients to minimize cost in a functional context.",
