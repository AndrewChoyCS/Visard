    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f).A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost).The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) costs. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of finding minimum cost values in Gradient Descent, visualized as navigating a bowl-shaped cost function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent using a bowl-shaped cost function. The goal is to visually represent how different coefficient values result in varying costs, depicted as points on the surface of the bowl. Highlight the journey toward the minimum point (the bottom of the bowl), illustrating how each iteration moves closer to this minimum by indicating lower costs with arrows or pathways. This visualization should utilize a combination of a 3D diagram to represent the bowl and overlays or animations to demonstrate the iterative movements of coefficients. By clearly depicting the relationships between coefficient changes and cost improvements, learners will grasp how Gradient Descent systematically seeks the optimal solution.\n\n**Learning Objective:** To facilitate a deep understanding of the iterative nature of Gradient Descent, enabling learners to visualize and comprehend how successive adjustments to coefficients lead to reduced costs, reinforcing the principle of optimization in machine learning.",
