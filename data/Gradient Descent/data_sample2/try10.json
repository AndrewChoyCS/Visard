    "data": "The loss functions for linear models always produce a convex surface. As a result of this property, when a linear regression model converges, we know the model has found the weights and bias that produce the lowest loss.If we graph the loss surface for a model with one feature, we can see its convex shape. The following is the loss surface of the miles per gallon dataset used in the previous examples. Weight is on the x-axis, bias is on the y-axis, and loss is on the z-axis:",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe convex nature of loss functions in linear regression, which guarantees the convergence to a global minimum, is a fundamental concept in understanding how linear models optimize their parameters.\n\n### Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the convex surface of loss functions in linear regression models. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the relationship between weights, bias, and loss is visually represented in a three-dimensional graph, demonstrating that the model converges to a global minimum. By illustrating this concept, learners will see that the convex shape implies that any point on the surface above the global minimum represents a higher loss. \n\nThe visualization should include a 3D graph where the x-axis represents weight, the y-axis represents bias, and the z-axis represents loss. Label the axes clearly and include contour lines to illustrate the gradient of loss values. The visual representation should also contrast a minimum loss point against various non-minimum points, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between model parameters and loss. \n\n### Objective\nBy the end of this visual learning experience, learners will be able to demonstrate a deep understanding of how the convexity of loss surfaces ensures that linear regression parameters converge optimally, allowing them to apply this knowledge in practical modeling scenarios involving linear regression.",
