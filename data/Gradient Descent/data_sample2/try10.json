    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convexity of loss surfaces in linear regression indicates that the model has identifiable minimum loss points once convergence is achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex nature of loss surfaces in linear regression models. The goal is to illustrate how the convex surface signifies that the model has reached the optimal weights and bias that minimize loss. This visualization should clarify the relationship between weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis), emphasizing the single minimum point where loss is minimized. Use a 3D surface plot to effectively convey this concept, and include contour lines to highlight the levels of loss, making it easier to discern the shape and identify the converging point visually.\n\nIncorporating best practices in instructional design, the visual will support learners in understanding the cause-effect relationship between the weights, bias, and loss, while also providing a comparative analysis of loss levels across different weight and bias combinations. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to articulate how the convex nature of the loss surface in linear regression models ensures that a minimum loss can be achieved with the appropriate weights and bias, reinforcing their understanding of gradient descent and model convergence.",
