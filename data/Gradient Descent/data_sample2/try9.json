    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative optimization technique.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how gradient descent works in finding the minimum value of a loss function through a process of incremental adjustments based on the function's derivative. The specific concept to clarify is the relationship between the position of an initial guess for the parameter, the sign of the derivative at that point, and how it informs the next guess in the iterative process. \n\nThe visualization should incorporate multiple graphs: one showing the loss function, another showing its derivative with points where the derivative equals zero highlighted, and arrows illustrating the movement of guesses based on the sign of the derivative. Using a combination of line graphs and directional arrows would be effective here. This visual aids in understanding by clearly depicting the process from an initial guess to subsequent guesses, revealing the immediate feedback loop between the guess and the function's slope.\n\n**Educational Outcome:** The visualization should facilitate a deep understanding of how gradient descent navigates the loss landscape to minimize a function, emphasizing the iterative nature of the process and the critical role of the derivative in guiding the optimization steps.",
