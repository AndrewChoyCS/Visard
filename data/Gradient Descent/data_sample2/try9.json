    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\nThe convex nature of the loss surface in linear regression indicates that the model converges to the minimum loss with optimal weights and bias.\n\n### Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the convex nature of the loss surface in linear regression.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the weights (x-axis) and bias (y-axis) interact to form a convex surface, with loss (z-axis) being minimized at the apex. This visual should clarify the importance of the convex shape, highlighting how it guarantees convergence to the lowest loss, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of gradient descent. \n\nIncorporate 3D graphs to depict the loss surface of the miles per gallon dataset, showcasing contours or color gradients to represent varying loss levels. Additionally, annotate the graph to indicate optimal points of convergence and paths of gradient descent. This approach aids in comprehending cause-effect relationships and reinforces the concept of loss minimization by visualizing the path taken to reach the optimal solution.\n\n### Educational Objective:\nEnhance learners' understanding of how the convexity of the loss surface ensures that linear regression models will converge to the global minimum loss, fostering a foundational comprehension of gradient descent mechanics.",
