    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex shape of the loss surface for linear models guarantees that convergence leads to the optimal weights and bias in linear regression.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex loss surface of linear models in the context of linear regression. The goal is to illustrate how the loss function's convex shape ensures that as the algorithm converges, it finds the global minimum of loss, represented by the optimal weights and bias. This visualization should focus on the relationship between the weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis) using a 3D surface graph demonstrating the convexity clearly. By incorporating contour plots alongside the 3D graph, the visualization can also highlight how different weight and bias combinations correlate with varying loss values, illustrating the idea of convergence and optimality effectively. \n\n**Objective:** Students should achieve a profound understanding of how the convex nature of the loss function in linear regression guarantees the discovery of the best parameters during gradient descent, reinforcing their knowledge of optimization in machine learning. By visualizing the relationship between parameters and loss, learners will better grasp the significance of convexity in loss functions and its implication in model convergence.",
