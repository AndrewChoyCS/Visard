For the calculus approach, we assumed that the loss function was differentiable at all points and that we could algebraically solve for the zero points of the derivative; for the geometric approach, OLS *only* applies when using a linear model with MSE loss. What happens when we have more complex models with different, more complex loss functions?

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative optimization technique to find the minimum of a loss function.** The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the function's value, its derivative, and how guesses for the minimizing parameter (\\(\\theta\\)) are adjusted based on whether the current guess is too low or too high. This could be effectively presented as a flowchart combined with graphs showing the function, its derivative, and the changing values of \\(\\theta\\) as the optimization progresses.\n\nThe goal is to help learners visualize the iterative process of gradient descent, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationships between the guesses for \\(\\theta\\) and the corresponding changes in the derivative (negative or positive), thus clarifying how those adjustments guide the optimization toward the minimum. The visual aids will enhance understanding by providing a clear depiction of the sequence of adjustments, demonstrating the dynamic movement towards the optimal value based on the slope of the function.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will gain a deep understanding of how gradient descent works as an iterative method of optimization, learning how derivative signs influence the next guess for minimizing the loss function and reinforcing the concept of navigating a function\u2019s landscape in pursuit of its minimum.",
