    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the principle of iterative optimization in gradient descent.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the iterative process of adjusting guesses based on the derivative helps locate the minimum value of a loss function. Specifically, it will clarify the relationship between the position of the guess (\u03b8), the derivative (positive or negative), and the movement towards or away from the optimal solution (\u03b8*). \n\nThe visual can take the form of a dynamic graph that shows the curve of the loss function alongside its derivative, highlighting points where the derivative equals zero. Additionally, include arrows indicating movement toward the optimal value based on the sign of the derivative. \n\nThis representation will aid learners in grasping the sequential process of using the derivative to inform adjustments to guesses, reinforcing the iterative nature of gradient descent. The objective is to ensure that learners understand how to interpret the derivative of a function as a guide for navigating towards its minimum, thus deepening their comprehension of gradient-based optimization techniques.",
