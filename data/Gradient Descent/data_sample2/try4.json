As a result of this property, when a linear regression model converges, we know the model has found the weights and bias that produce the lowest loss.If we graph the loss surface for a model with one feature, we can see its convex shape.

    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex nature of loss functions in linear models ensures that convergence leads to the optimal weights and bias, where the lowest loss is achieved.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex shape of loss surfaces in linear regression models. The goal is to illustrate how the convexity of the loss function guarantees that the model converges to the optimal weights and bias, resulting in the lowest possible loss. This visualization should clearly depict the relationship between weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis) in a three-dimensional graph. Additionally, consider using contour plots or color gradients to indicate regions of higher and lower loss values, thus reinforcing the understanding of where the optimal solution lies. By highlighting these relationships, the visual will guide learners in comprehending how the convex nature of the loss surface allows for a single global minimum, reinforcing the principle of Gradient Descent in a clear manner.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually interpret and explain how the convex shape of the loss function in linear regression facilitates the convergence to an optimal solution, enhancing their understanding of the underlying principles of Gradient Descent and its efficacy in machine learning models.",
