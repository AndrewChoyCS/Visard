For the calculus approach, we assumed that the loss function was differentiable at all points and that we could algebraically solve for the zero points of the derivative; for the geometric approach, OLS *only* applies when using a linear model with MSE loss. What happens when we have more complex models with different, more complex loss functions? The techniques we've learned so far will not work, so we need a new optimization technique: **gradient descent**. Looking at the function across this domain, it is clear that the function's minimum value occurs around $\\theta = 5.3$. Let's pretend for a moment that we *couldn't* see the full view of the cost function. How would we guess the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes the function? Let's consider an arbitrary function.

    "goal": "### Query for Visualization Expert\n\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of using gradient descent to find the minimum of a complex loss function.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how iterative adjustments to an initial guess of the parameter value, based on the slope indicated by the function\u2019s derivative, leads to the optimal solution. Focus on the dynamic relationship between the parameter guess versus the actual minimum, emphasizing the feedback loop of guessing too high or too low and adjusting accordingly. \n\nUse a dual-panel design: one side displaying the function and its derivative, highlighting the regions where the derivative is negative (indicating a need to increase the guess) and positive (indicating a need to decrease the guess). The other panel should showcase a step-by-step iteration process, visually tracking how the parameter value evolves towards the minimum point. \n\nThis visualization style can include line graphs for the function and its derivative, alongside animated arrows or markers to denote direction changes in the guessing process. It will aid in understanding the iterative nature of gradient descent, fostering a clearer grasp of the relationship between slopes and optimal parameter values, thereby solidifying a learner's comprehensive understanding of optimization principles.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of this visualization is to deepen students' understanding of gradient descent by illustrating how the iterative adjustments toward minimizing a complex loss function are influenced by the slope of the function. This will help them grasp the importance of derivative values in guiding their guesses during the optimization process.",
