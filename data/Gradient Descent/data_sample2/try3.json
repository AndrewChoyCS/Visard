    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The convex nature of loss functions for linear regression models ensures that convergence leads to the optimal weights and bias, thereby minimizing the loss.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex loss surface associated with linear regression models. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis) in a three-dimensional graph, clearly demonstrating how the shape of the loss surface impacts convergence. This visualization should depict the convex surface and highlight the point of lowest loss, providing learners with a deep understanding of why linear regression finds optimal solutions. By using a 3D surface plot, accompanied by annotations and gradients that indicate loss values, the visual will clarify the implications of convexity in loss functions and reinforce the concept that a single global minimum exists in these surfaces.\n\n**Objective:** To deepen learners' understanding of how the convex nature of loss surfaces affects the optimization process in linear regression, ensuring they can identify and articulate why convergence indicates optimal weight and bias parameters in practical applications.",
