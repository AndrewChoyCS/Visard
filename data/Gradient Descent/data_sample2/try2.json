    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in finding the minimum of a cost function.** The goal is to clarify how the first derivative of a function informs adjustments to the parameter \\(\\theta\\) during optimization. By illustrating various points on the function curve and their corresponding slopes (derivatives), viewers will understand how to interpret positive and negative gradients and how these lead to successive guesses for \\(\\theta\\). \n\nThe visualization could be presented as a multi-layered diagram that includes the cost function curve, the derivative curve, and annotated arrows showing the iterative updating of \\(\\theta\\) based on whether the guess undershot or overshot the optimal value, including their respective impacts on the derivative. This approach will deepen understanding of the dynamics of gradient descent, highlighting how the process navigates the cost function's landscape towards the minimum.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the gradient descent optimization algorithm by visualizing the influence of derivatives on iterative adjustments of parameters, ultimately enabling them to apply the concept to more complex models beyond linear regression.",
