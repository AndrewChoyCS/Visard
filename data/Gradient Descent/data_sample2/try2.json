    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex nature of loss functions in linear models and its implications for convergence in linear regression.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex surface of loss functions in linear regression models. The goal is to illustrate how the convexity guarantees convergence to the lowest loss, highlighting the relationship between weights (x-axis), biases (y-axis), and loss (z-axis). This visualization should depict a 3D graph showcasing the loss surface, emphasizing the point of convergence that represents the optimal weights and bias. It should include gradient descent paths to illustrate how the model iteratively approaches this minimum loss point. \n\nFor added clarity, consider using color gradients to indicate areas of higher vs. lower loss and incorporating arrows to denote the direction of descent. This visual representation will deepen learners' comprehension by clearly showing the relationship between the parameters and their impact on loss, ultimately helping them appreciate how convexity plays a crucial role in model training and optimization.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of the visualization, learners should be able to articulate how the convexity of loss functions affects the convergence of linear regression models and recognize the significance of this property in guiding the optimization process through gradient descent.",
