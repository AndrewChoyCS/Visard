    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as an iterative optimization technique.** The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how gradient descent allows us to iteratively adjust our guesses for the optimal parameter value (\u03b8) based on the slope of the loss function. This visualization should clarify the relationship between a function, its derivative, and the adjustments we make to our guesses when overshooting or undershooting the minimum. \n\nAn effective style for this visualization could be a dynamic infographic or an animated diagram that shows the loss function\u2019s curve alongside its derivative, while indicating the current guess and the adjustments made at each step. It should highlight how the sign of the derivative influences the direction of the next guess (move left if overshot, move right if undershot).\n\nBy visually representing these iterative steps and the corresponding changes in the function's value, learners can better grasp the cause-and-effect relationship inherent in the gradient descent process. The objective is for learners to deeply understand how to apply gradient descent to find optimal parameter values, and to recognize the influence of derivative signs on this optimization path.",
