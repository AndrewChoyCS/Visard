    "data": "The loss functions for linear models always produce a convex surface. As a result of this property, when a linear regression model converges, we know the model has found the weights and bias that produce the lowest loss.If we graph the loss surface for a model with one feature, we can see its convex shape. The following is the loss surface of the miles per gallon dataset used in the previous examples. Weight is on the x-axis, bias is on the y-axis, and loss is on the z-axis:",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex nature of loss surfaces in linear models ensures that convergence indicates an optimal solution in terms of weights and bias.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex surface of loss functions in linear models. The goal is to illustrate how the shape of the loss surface guarantees that the model has converged to the optimal weights and bias once it reaches the minimum point. This visualization should clarify the relationship between weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis) by depicting the convex surface distinctly, highlighting the lowest point as the optimal solution. A 3D surface plot would effectively convey these relationships and provide clear labels and color gradients to indicate varying loss levels. This visual should also include a marked trajectory showing the descent toward convergence, thus enhancing learners' understanding of how the convex surface plays a critical role in optimization.\n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of the role of convexity in loss functions, learners will be able to analyze and interpret the significance of the loss surface in determining optimal model parameters in linear regression.",
