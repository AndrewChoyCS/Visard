    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex nature of the loss function in linear models illustrates that as the model converges during training, it finds the optimal weights and bias values that result in the minimum loss.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of the convex surface of loss functions in linear regression models. The goal is to clearly illustrate how the relationship between weights (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis) forms a convex shape. The visualization should emphasize the idea that the lowest point on the surface corresponds to the optimal parameters, reinforcing the understanding of convergence in gradient descent. A 3D surface plot should be used to showcase the convex shape effectively, potentially accompanied by contour plots to highlight the locations of different loss levels. This will help learners grasp the cause-and-effect relationship between parameter adjustments and loss reduction, deepening their insights into how gradient descent operates within linear regression models.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of how the convex nature of loss functions leads to the identification of optimal weights and biases in linear regression, illustrating the efficiency of the gradient descent method in minimizing loss.",
