    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convex nature of loss surfaces in linear models and its implications for convergence in gradient descent.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convex surface of loss functions in linear regression models. The goal is to illustrate how this convexity ensures that, as the model converges, it identifies the optimal weights and bias that minimize loss. This representation should clarify the relationship between weight (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis), emphasizing how all paths lead to a single global minimum. Suggested visualization styles include a 3D graph of the loss surface, accompanied by a gradient descent path overlay to show progression towards the minimum. This visual will aid in understanding the stability and efficiency of convergence in gradient descent, deepening the learner's insight into why linear models behave as they do in optimization scenarios.\n\n**Objective:** Students will critically evaluate the impact of convexity on convergence in linear regression by analyzing the loss surface visualization, thereby enhancing their fundamental understanding of optimization principles within the context of gradient descent.",
