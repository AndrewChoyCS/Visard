    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent using the context of a loss function's minimum value.** \n\nThe goal is to illustrate how the choice of $\\theta$ influences the loss function's value and how the first derivative informs the guesses for the optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the location of $\\theta$, the sign of the derivative (positive or negative), and the adjustments made in subsequent guesses to hone in on the minimum value. \n\nA flowchart or animated graph would be effective, showing a curve of the arbitrary function alongside its derivative, highlighting areas where the derivative equals zero. Additionally, animate the process of adjusting $\\theta$, indicating when to increase or decrease based on the derivative's sign. This approach will deepen understanding by clearly demonstrating the relationship between gradient descent steps, improving learners' insights into optimization techniques.\n\n**Objective:** Students will grasp the iterative nature of gradient descent, recognizing how adjustments to variables based on derivative information lead to convergence on the minimum of a loss function.",
