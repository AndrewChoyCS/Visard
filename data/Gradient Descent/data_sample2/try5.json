    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted**: The iterative process of gradient descent for finding the minimum value of a loss function, utilizing the first derivative to guide guessing and adjustment of parameter values.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in identifying the minimum value of a loss function. The goal of this visualization is to demonstrate how adjustments to the parameter values, based on the sign of the derivative, lead to convergence towards the optimal parameter value. Key educational outcomes should include students' ability to conceptualize how initial guesses and gradient information influence subsequent adjustments in parameter values, ultimately guiding them toward the function's minimum.\n\nThe visualization should illustrate the relationship between the function, its derivative, and the iterative steps of gradient descent. Consider a diagram with multiple panels: one panel can show the function itself, another can depict its derivative with points of zero crossing, and a third can visualize arrows indicating the direction of movement based on positive or negative derivatives. This structured approach clarifies the iterative nature of the algorithm and highlights the cause-and-effect relationships as learners follow how a guess is refined through each iteration.\n\nThe objective is to facilitate a deep understanding of how gradient descent operates, emphasizing the relationship between guesses, derivatives, and adjustments in parameter values, while making the learning process intuitive and engaging.",
