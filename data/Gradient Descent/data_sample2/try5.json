    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\nThe convexity of the loss surface in linear regression indicates that there exists a unique minimum point (the optimal weights and bias) where the model converges to the lowest loss.\n\n### Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the convex nature of the loss surface in linear regression.** The goal is to illustrate how the weights and bias interact to create a convex surface, emphasizing that any point on this surface has a corresponding loss value, and the lowest point represents the optimal solution. This visualization should clarify the relationship between weights (x-axis), bias (y-axis), and loss (z-axis), helping learners to intuitively grasp how linear models converge to the best-fitting solution. Suggested styles include a 3D surface plot that shows the curvature of the loss surface alongside contour lines that highlight different loss levels. \n\nThis visual will aid in understanding how variations in weights and bias affect the outcome of the loss, ultimately highlighting the properties of convexity and the significance of convergence in gradient descent. \n\n### Objective:\nTo foster a deep understanding of the concept of convex loss surfaces in linear regression, students will learn how to identify the optimal weights and bias, interpret the loss function's behavior, and connect the visual curvature of the loss surface to gradient descent processes used in training linear models. This understanding will foundationally equip students with the ability to analyze and evaluate linear regression performance accurately.",
