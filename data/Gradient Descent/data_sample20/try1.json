    "data": "The Gradient Descent Algorithm functions by iteratively determining the following point based on the gradient at the current location. It scales the gradient by a learning rate and subtracts the resulting value from the current position, effectively taking a step. The subtraction aims at minimizing the objective function; alternatively, maximizing would involve an addition. This iterative process can be expressed mathematically as: p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n). An essential parameter in this method is \u03b7, which determines the scaling of the gradient and significantly impacts performance. A lower learning rate means that gradient descent takes longer to converge and might exhaust the maximum iterations before arriving at the optimum. Conversely, if the learning rate is excessively high, the algorithm may oscillate around the optimal point or fail to converge entirely. In summary, the procedure of the Gradient Descent method includes: 1. selecting an initial point, 2. calculating the gradient at that point, 3. making a scaled move opposite to the gradient (with the goal of minimization), 4. repeating steps 2 and 3 until one of the following conditions is met: the maximum iteration count is reached or the change in step size falls below a specified tolerance due to scaling or an overly small gradient.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative adjustment process of the Gradient Descent algorithm based on the gradient and learning rate, illustrating how it converges to a minimum point.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm and its reliance on the gradient and learning rate. The goal is to visually depict how the algorithm selects initial points, calculates gradients, and adjusts positions over iterations to converge toward the minimum of an objective function. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the gradient, learning rate, and convergence behavior, particularly demonstrating the effects of varying learning rates on the convergence process. \n\nConsider using a flowchart combined with graphs that show multiple iterations of the gradient descent path toward the minimum, highlighting points of convergence, oscillation, and stagnation based on different learning rates. This visual representation will deepen understanding of how the gradient and learning rate influence performance and convergence, facilitating a clear understanding of how each step in the algorithm contributes to finding the minimum.\n\n**Objective:** To equip learners with a comprehensive understanding of how the Gradient Descent algorithm operates through iterative adjustments, emphasizing the critical roles that the gradient and learning rate play in impacting convergence behavior.",
