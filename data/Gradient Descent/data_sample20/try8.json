    "data": "The Gradient Descent Algorithm functions by iteratively determining the following point based on the gradient at the current location. It scales the gradient by a learning rate and subtracts the resulting value from the current position, effectively taking a step. The subtraction aims at minimizing the objective function; alternatively, maximizing would involve an addition. This iterative process can be expressed mathematically as: p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n). An essential parameter in this method is \u03b7, which determines the scaling of the gradient and significantly impacts performance. A lower learning rate means that gradient descent takes longer to converge and might exhaust the maximum iterations before arriving at the optimum. Conversely, if the learning rate is excessively high, the algorithm may oscillate around the optimal point or fail to converge entirely. In summary, the procedure of the Gradient Descent method includes: 1. selecting an initial point, 2. calculating the gradient at that point, 3. making a scaled move opposite to the gradient (with the goal of minimization), 4. repeating steps 2 and 3 until one of the following conditions is met: the maximum iteration count is reached or the change in step size falls below a specified tolerance due to scaling or an overly small gradient.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative nature of the Gradient Descent Algorithm and the impact of the learning rate on convergence.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Algorithm and the role of the learning rate (\u03b7) in influencing convergence and performance. The goal is to clearly illustrate the sequence of steps in the algorithm, starting from the initial point to the optimal value while emphasizing how the adjustment of learning rate can either slow down or destabilize the convergence process. Use a combination of a flowchart and a graph: the flowchart should depict each iterative step of the algorithm (selecting an initial point, calculating the gradient, making adjustments, and checking convergence criteria), while the graph should display how different learning rates affect the path taken toward the optimal point. This visualization will aid in understanding the cause-effect relationship between the learning rate and convergence behavior, enhancing learners' grasp of how to choose appropriate parameters in practical applications. \n\n**Educational Outcomes**: By the end of this visualization, learners should be able to:\n1. Identify the sequential steps involved in the Gradient Descent Algorithm.\n2. Understand how the learning rate influences the algorithm's performance, with a clear grasp of the trade-offs between convergence speed and stability.\n3. Apply this knowledge in practical scenarios to select optimal learning rates for various optimization tasks.",
