    "data": "The Gradient Descent Algorithm functions by iteratively determining the following point based on the gradient at the current location. It scales the gradient by a learning rate and subtracts the resulting value from the current position, effectively taking a step. The subtraction aims at minimizing the objective function; alternatively, maximizing would involve an addition. This iterative process can be expressed mathematically as: p_{n+1} = p_n - \u03b7 * \u2207f(p_n). An essential parameter in this method is \u03b7, which determines the scaling of the gradient and significantly impacts performance. A lower learning rate means that gradient descent takes longer to converge and might exhaust the maximum iterations before arriving at the optimum. Conversely, if the learning rate is excessively high, the algorithm may oscillate around the optimal point or fail to converge entirely. In summary, the procedure of the Gradient Descent method includes: 1. selecting an initial point, 2. calculating the gradient at that point, 3. making a scaled move opposite to the gradient (with the goal of minimization), 4. repeating steps 2 and 3 until one of the following conditions is met: the maximum iteration count is reached or the change in step size falls below a specified tolerance due to scaling or an overly small gradient.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\nThe iterative process of Gradient Descent, focusing on how the learning rate (\\( \\eta \\)) affects convergence towards the optimal point and the resultant behavior of the algorithm based on varying learning rates.\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent with a focus on the impact of different learning rates (\\( \\eta \\)). The goal is to illustrate how the algorithm effectively takes steps towards minimizing the objective function by moving against the gradient and how varying the learning rate can affect the convergence path. This visualization should clarify the relationships between learning rate values, movement towards the optimum, and the resulting convergence behavior\u2014showing examples of sufficiently low, ideal, and excessively high learning rates. \n\nThe visualization could be presented as a series of graphs depicting trajectories of convergence on a contour plot, with overlays highlighting the gradient at various points and annotations to outline the impact of the learning rate on convergence behavior (e.g., too slow, appropriate, too fast). This approach emphasizes the cause-effect relationship between learning rate and convergence success, enabling learners to grasp the critical role of \\( \\eta \\) in the Gradient Descent algorithm. \n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nStudents will understand that:\n1. The learning rate plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of the Gradient Descent algorithm.\n2. The visual representation will illustrate the relationship between different learning rates and their resultant impact on convergence patterns, deepening their insight into algorithm behavior and optimization. \n3. Learners will be able to identify scenarios where a certain learning rate may lead to failures in convergence, enhancing their practical understanding of optimization techniques.",
