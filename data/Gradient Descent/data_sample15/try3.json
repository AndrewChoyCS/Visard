    "data": "Consider a deep, curved dish, similar to one you might use for cereal or to hold fruit. This dish represents a visualization of the cost function (f). A random point located somewhere on the dish signifies the current costs associated with certain coefficient values (cost). The lower part of this dish represents the minimal cost achieved with the optimal coefficients, reflecting the lowest point on the function. The aim is to experimentally adjust the coefficients, analyzing their associated costs and choosing new ones that demonstrate a minor improvement (lower costs). By continuously repeating this method, you approach the dish\u2019s bottom and effectively identify the coefficient values that achieve the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The optimization process of gradient descent, where the goal is to iteratively adjust coefficients to minimize cost by navigating towards the lowest point on a cost function represented by a curved surface.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of navigating through a cost function in gradient descent. The visualization should depict the curved dish representing the cost function, with a random point illustrating the current cost associated with particular coefficient values. Additionally, use arrows to represent the iterative adjustments made to these coefficients as the learner moves toward the dish\u2019s lowest point, which symbolizes the optimal coefficients. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify how gradient descent iteratively seeks out minimum cost solutions through the adjustment of coefficients and how this process aggregates steps toward an optimal outcome. By employing an interactive infographic style, learners can better grasp the relationships between cost, coefficient adjustments, and the path taken to achieve minimal cost. This visual aids in understanding the sequential nature of gradient descent, highlighting how small changes can lead to significant improvements in cost.\n\n**Educational Objective**: Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the gradient descent optimization technique, including its iterative nature, the significance of cost evaluation at various coefficient stages, and the overall goal of finding the optimal values that minimize cost.",
