    "data": "Consider a deep, curved dish, similar to one you might use for cereal or to hold fruit. This dish represents a visualization of the cost function (f). A random point located somewhere on the dish signifies the current costs associated with certain coefficient values (cost). The lower part of this dish represents the minimal cost achieved with the optimal coefficients, reflecting the lowest point on the function. The aim is to experimentally adjust the coefficients, analyzing their associated costs and choosing new ones that demonstrate a minor improvement (lower costs). By continuously repeating this method, you approach the dish\u2019s bottom and effectively identify the coefficient values that achieve the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of adjusting coefficients to minimize costs in the context of gradient descent.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of gradient descent as represented by a deep, curved dish. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the concept of finding minimal costs through the systematic adjustment of coefficients. The visual should depict the dish as a 3D surface graph, with a marked initial random cost point and arrows illustrating potential paths taken with each adjustment towards the lowest point (optimal coefficients). An infographic style is recommended, integrating color gradients to indicate varying cost levels and labeled pathways showing the feedback loop of analysis and adjustment. This will aid learners in understanding how each step influences the overall progress toward minimizing costs, thus clarifying the cause-effect relationships involved in the gradient descent process.\n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand the iterative process of gradient descent by visualizing how each adjustment of coefficients leads to a progressive decrease in cost, emphasizing the significance of experimentation and feedback in achieving optimization.",
