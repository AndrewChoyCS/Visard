    "data": "Consider a deep, curved dish, similar to one you might use for cereal or to hold fruit. This dish represents a visualization of the cost function (f). A random point located somewhere on the dish signifies the current costs associated with certain coefficient values (cost). The lower part of this dish represents the minimal cost achieved with the optimal coefficients, reflecting the lowest point on the function. The aim is to experimentally adjust the coefficients, analyzing their associated costs and choosing new ones that demonstrate a minor improvement (lower costs). By continuously repeating this method, you approach the dish\u2019s bottom and effectively identify the coefficient values that achieve the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of optimizing coefficients through iterative adjustments to minimize cost in a cost function represented by a curved dish.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of optimizing coefficients in gradient descent by using a curved dish as the cost function. The visualization should illustrate a gradient descent trajectory on the dish, showing how a current point (representing a specific set of coefficients) can adjust to lower costs by moving closer to the dish's bottom, where the optimal coefficients lie. Include arrows to represent direction of movement and emphasize the decreasing cost function values along this path. Use a diagram style to convey the relationships between the starting points, adjustment steps, and the minimal cost outcomes. \n\nThis visual will aid in understanding how small adjustments (iterations) lead towards achieving minimum costs, reinforcing the sequential nature of the optimization process and emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between coefficient changes and cost reduction. The expected educational outcomes are to deepen students' comprehension of gradient descent principles, sequential adjustments, and the concept of convergence toward optimal solutions in a visual, intuitive manner.",
