    "goal": "### Core Principle:\n**The necessity of gradient descent as an iterative optimization method for complex models and loss functions that cannot be solved analytically.**\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent and its role in optimizing complex loss functions. The goal is to illustrate how gradient descent operates on an undefined cost function by showing the iterative adjustment of parameter values (\u03b8) to approach the minimum point, especially when the function's entire structure is not visible.\n\nThe visualization should include a graph depicting a hypothetical cost function along with its derivative, emphasizing the behavior of the function as \u03b8 changes. Incorporate arrows to indicate the movement of \u03b8 towards the local minimum and highlight the significance of the first derivative in guiding this process. This will clarify the relationship between current parameter estimates and their adjustments toward optimal values.\n\n### Expected Educational Outcomes:\n- Students will grasp how gradient descent serves as a practical approach to optimization when traditional methods fall short in complex scenarios.\n- Learners will understand the iterative nature of gradient descent and the concepts of local minima and derivatives in optimization.\n- The visualization aims to deepen insights into cause-effect relationships (e.g., how the first derivative informs the movement toward the loss minimum) and promote an understanding of the sequence of steps taken in the gradient descent process.\n\nIn this way, the visual will aid in comprehensively understanding the necessity and functionality of gradient descent in practical machine learning applications, reinforcing the importance of iterative optimization techniques.",
