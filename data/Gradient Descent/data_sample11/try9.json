    "goal": "**Extracted Principle**: The necessity of gradient descent as an iterative optimization method when dealing with complex loss functions and non-differentiable scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in the context of optimizing complex loss functions. The goal is to clarify how gradient descent navigates through different values of the parameter $\\theta$ to find the minimum loss. This visualization should highlight the relationship between the parameter values, the resulting loss function, and the direction of descent on the graph. \n\nTo effectively convey this concept, consider using a flowchart combined with a line graph that shows both the loss function and the gradient at different iterations. Each step in the flowchart could represent a new guess for $\\theta$, demonstrating how the algorithm adjusts its estimates based on the slope of the loss function. The educational outcomes expected include a deepened understanding of how gradient descent operates iteratively, the significance of the derivative in guiding the optimization, and the way in which specific parameter adjustments can lead to convergence on the minimum loss.\n\nThis visualization will enhance comprehension by clearly illustrating the dynamic process of adjusting parameters and the resulting changes in loss, making it easier for learners to grasp the function of gradient descent as a critical optimization technique in machine learning.",
