    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The necessity and methodology of using gradient descent as an optimization technique for complex, non-differentiable loss functions in models beyond basic linear assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process and benefits of using gradient descent for optimizing loss functions in complex models. The visualization should illustrate how gradient descent iteratively converges towards the minimum loss value, emphasizing the relationship between the function, its derivative, and the trial values of parameters (like $\\theta$). \n\nThis could be structured as a flowchart showing the steps involved in the gradient descent process, alongside graphs comparing the function with its derivative, highlighting points where gradients indicate movement toward the minimum. The educational outcomes should include understanding how and why gradient descent is applicable to complex models, recognizing the significance of the derivative in guiding parameter adjustments, and illustrating how iterative processes enhance convergence to optimal values. \n\nThe chosen visualization style\u2014a flowchart combined with dynamic graphs\u2014will effectively depict the relationships and sequences in the gradient descent algorithm, making it easier for learners to grasp the concept of iterative optimization and its critical role in navigating complex functions.",
