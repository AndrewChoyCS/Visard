A random spot on the inside surface of the bowl signifies the cost tied to the current values of the coefficients (cost). The very lowest point in the bowl indicates the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, essentially the minimum of the function. The objective is to trial various coefficient values one at a time, assess their costs, and pick new coefficient values that yield a slightly improved (lower) cost.

    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize: The Process of Gradient Descent as Navigating a Cost Function Landscape**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as a method for minimizing a cost function represented by a bowl-like structure. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the iterative process of selecting coefficient values, evaluating their associated costs, and gradually finding the optimal set of coefficients that minimize the cost. This visualization should clearly show the relationships between the position on the bowl, the corresponding cost, and the iterative movement towards the bowl's minimum. An appropriate style for this visualization could be an infographic that combines a top-down view of the bowl with arrows indicating movement towards the minimum point, labeled cost values at various positions, and a sequence of iterations leading to the optimal solution. The visual will aid in understanding how each step is a deliberate attempt to lower the cost, thereby deepening the learner\u2019s grasp of the gradient descent process and its application in optimization tasks.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of how the iterative process of gradient descent operates within the context of a cost function, emphasizing the systematic approach of trial, assessment, and adjustment toward minimizing error\u2014key concepts for mastering optimization techniques in machine learning.",
