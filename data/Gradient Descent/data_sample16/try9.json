    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of Gradient Descent as a method to minimize cost by selecting optimal coefficient values, visualized as a journey down a bowl-shaped cost function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent using the metaphor of a deep bowl. The visualization should depict the bowl-shaped graph of the cost function, highlighting various points representing coefficient values and their corresponding costs. Key elements should include a visual path indicating progressive trials of different coefficients leading towards the bowl's lowest point, which represents the optimal coefficients with minimal cost. \n\nThe goal is to clarify how each trial's cost impacts the selection of subsequent coefficients, emphasizing the relationships between initial trials and the eventual convergence on the minimum cost. Recommended styles include an infographic or a sequence diagram that illustrates both the sequential process of trialing coefficients and the cause-effect relationship between changes in coefficients and their resulting costs. \n\nBy engaging with this visual, learners should gain a deeper understanding of how each small adjustment leads towards the optimal solution and grasp the concept of minimizing costs over iterations in Gradient Descent. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Deepen the understanding of the iterative process of Gradient Descent and its role in optimization by visualizing how coefficient adjustments affect cost, leading to the ultimate goal of minimizing that cost effectively.",
