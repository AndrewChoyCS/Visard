    "data": "Consider the image of a deep, round bowl, much like the ones used for cereal or holding fruit. This bowl represents the graph of the cost function (f). A random spot on the inside surface of the bowl signifies the cost tied to the current values of the coefficients (cost). The very lowest point in the bowl indicates the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, essentially the minimum of the function. The objective is to trial various coefficient values one at a time, assess their costs, and pick new coefficient values that yield a slightly improved (lower) cost. By systematically repeating this process, overtimeone approaches the bottom of the bowl, ultimately identifying the coefficients that deliver the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of iteratively adjusting coefficients to minimize the cost function, represented as a journey towards the lowest point in the bowl, illustrating the concept of gradient descent.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent in relation to the cost function represented by a deep bowl. The visualization should illustrate the bowl as a three-dimensional surface displaying the cost values, with a series of markers or arrows indicating various coefficient values chosen at different stages of the optimization process. Each marker should represent a point where the cost was evaluated, and arrows should demonstrate the movement towards the minimum cost at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThis visualization aims to clarify the concept of how adjusting coefficients affects cost and underscores the progressive nature of the optimization process. By depicting the relationship between the coefficients and their corresponding costs, the visual should help learners understand the cause-effect dynamics of this iterative process, showing both the concept of local minima and the overall goal of reaching the minimum cost efficiently. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of how gradient descent operates, including the sequential nature of selecting coefficients and evaluating costs, as well as recognizing the significance of reaching the lowest point in the cost function. A 3D surface plot style with annotations for key terms (like \"Optimal Coefficients\", \"Cost\", and \"Iteration Steps\") can help illustrate these concepts effectively, providing clarity on the relationships and sequences involved.",
