    "data": "Consider the image of a deep, round bowl, much like the ones used for cereal or holding fruit. This bowl represents the graph of the cost function (f). A random spot on the inside surface of the bowl signifies the cost tied to the current values of the coefficients (cost). The very lowest point in the bowl indicates the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, essentially the minimum of the function. The objective is to trial various coefficient values one at a time, assess their costs, and pick new coefficient values that yield a slightly improved (lower) cost. By systematically repeating this process, overtimeone approaches the bottom of the bowl, ultimately identifying the coefficients that deliver the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle: The iterative process of adjusting coefficients in Gradient Descent to minimize cost as visualized by the shape of a bowl.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent as represented by a deep, round bowl. The goal is to illustrate how different coefficient values correspond to various cost levels represented on the bowl's surface, with the lowest point signifying the optimal coefficients. This visualization should clarify the sequential process of choosing coefficient values, calculating their costs, and refining selections based on improvement. A combination of a 3D diagram of the bowl and a flowchart detailing the steps of the trial-and-error process would be effective. By showcasing the relationships between coefficients and their costs, learners can deeply understand how systematic adjustments lead to the minimization of the cost function. \n\n**Learning Objective:**\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a comprehensive understanding of the Gradient Descent method, including its iterative nature and the cause-effect relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost reduction.",
