    "data": "Imagine a deep, wide bowl reminiscent of one used for eating cereal or displaying fruit. This bowl represents your cost function (f). Picking a random spot on the bowl's surface corresponds to the current value of the coefficients you have, known as the cost. The lowest point of the bowl symbolizes the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, or the function's minimum point. The objective is to explore various coefficient values, assessing their costs and choosing those that show slightly improved (lower) costs. By iterating this method consistently, you will eventually find success at the bottom of the bowl, uncovering the coefficient values that yield the minimized cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The process of iteratively finding the optimal coefficients that minimize the cost function through exploration of the cost landscape.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent in finding the optimal set of coefficients represented by a bowl-shaped cost function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationship between the coefficients and their associated costs at various points on the bowl, culminating in the lowest cost at the bottom. Through this visual, learners should grasp how each step in the iteration represents an exploration of the cost landscape, selecting improved coefficients that lead closer to the minimum. \n\nThe visualization should utilize a 3D diagram showcasing the bowl's surface as the cost function, with distinct markers representing various coefficient positions and their costs. Incorporating arrows or paths to demonstrate the iterative journey towards the bowl\u2019s lowest point can help learners understand the sequential and cause-effect relationships inherent in the Gradient Descent method. This will deepen their insight into how minor adjustments yield improved results and ultimately lead to an optimal solution.\n\n**Learning Objective:** By working with this visualization, learners will develop a comprehensive understanding of Gradient Descent, recognizing it not only as a process of minimizing costs but also as an iterative exploration of the cost function space.",
