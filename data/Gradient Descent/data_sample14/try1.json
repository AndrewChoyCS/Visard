    "data": "Imagine a deep, wide bowl reminiscent of one used for eating cereal or displaying fruit. This bowl represents your cost function (f). Picking a random spot on the bowl's surface corresponds to the current value of the coefficients you have, known as the cost. The lowest point of the bowl symbolizes the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, or the function's minimum point. The objective is to explore various coefficient values, assessing their costs and choosing those that show slightly improved (lower) costs. By iterating this method consistently, you will eventually find success at the bottom of the bowl, uncovering the coefficient values that yield the minimized cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted: The Iterative Process of Gradient Descent to Minimize Cost Functions**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as represented by a deep, wide bowl. The visualization should illustrate how navigating different points on the surface of the bowl corresponds to testing various coefficient values and their resulting costs, ultimately leading to the optimal solution at the bottom of the bowl. Focus on showcasing the relationships between the current cost, selected coefficients, and the target minimum cost in a clear, sequential manner. \n\nConsider utilizing a 3D diagram displaying the bowl with points representing various coefficient costs, animated arrows indicating movement towards the minimum point, and labels to clarify each step of the gradient descent process. This visual should help learners grasp how small adjustments in coefficients lead to improved cost outcomes and the cumulative nature of these iterations, deepening their understanding of how optimization occurs over multiple steps.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe objective is to foster a deep understanding of how the gradient descent method iteratively approaches the minimum cost function, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between coefficient adjustments and cost minimization. Through this visualization, learners will be able to appreciate both the conceptual framework and the practical application of gradient descent in optimization problems.",
