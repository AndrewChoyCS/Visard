    "data": "Imagine a large bowl similar to the one you might use for breakfast cereal or to hold fruit. This bowl represents the cost function (f). At a specific random location on the inner surface of the bowl lies the current cost associated with the existing set of coefficients (cost). The lowest point in the bowl denotes the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, which reflects the minimum of the function. The objective is to iteratively test different values for these coefficients, assess their corresponding costs, and then choose new coefficient values that yield a lower cost. By continuously repeating this method, you can approach the bottom of the bowl, identifying the coefficient values that ultimately reduce the cost to its minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of finding optimal coefficients through minimizing the cost function represented by a bowl.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as represented by a bowl-like cost function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how various sets of coefficients are tested at different points along the inner surface of the bowl, corresponding to their cost values. It should depict the path taken toward the minimum point in the bowl, signifying the convergence of coefficients that lead to the lowest cost. The visualization should employ a flowchart style to show the sequence of iterations, highlighting the cause-effect relationship between the adjustments made to the coefficients and their impact on cost, along with arrows pointing toward the optimal solution at the bowl's lowest point. \n\nThis visual will aid learners in understanding the methodical approach of gradient descent step-by-step, clarifying the sequential process and the relationships between coefficient adjustments and cost reduction. \n\n**Objective:** To enable students to deeply comprehend the iterative nature of gradient descent in optimizing coefficients by visualizing the relationship between the current cost and the optimal solution, ultimately fostering their ability to apply this concept to various machine learning algorithms.",
