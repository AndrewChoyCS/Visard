    "data": "Imagine a large bowl similar to the one you might use for breakfast cereal or to hold fruit. This bowl represents the cost function (f). At a specific random location on the inner surface of the bowl lies the current cost associated with the existing set of coefficients (cost). The lowest point in the bowl denotes the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, which reflects the minimum of the function. The objective is to iteratively test different values for these coefficients, assess their corresponding costs, and then choose new coefficient values that yield a lower cost. By continuously repeating this method, you can approach the bottom of the bowl, identifying the coefficient values that ultimately reduce the cost to its minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Iterative Approach of Gradient Descent Towards Minimizing Cost**\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent as it approaches the optimal set of coefficient values represented by the lowest point in a cost function, illustrated as a bowl. The visualization should depict key stages in the process, including the starting random location (current cost) and sequential movements towards lower costs (coefficient adjustments). Using an infographic style, highlight the relationships between coefficient values, their corresponding costs, and the directional steps taken to minimize cost. This visual will clarify the cause-effect relationship inherent in iterative testing and decision-making in Gradient Descent. \n\nThe educational outcome expected is for learners to grasp not only what Gradient Descent is but also how it functions as a systematic process and its significance in minimizing costs in various applications. By illustrating sequential steps in a clear manner, learners can better understand the dynamics of iterative improvement and the convergence towards the minimum point, deepening their grasp of optimization techniques.",
