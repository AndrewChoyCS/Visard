    "data": "Imagine a large bowl similar to the one you might use for breakfast cereal or to hold fruit. This bowl represents the cost function (f). At a specific random location on the inner surface of the bowl lies the current cost associated with the existing set of coefficients (cost). The lowest point in the bowl denotes the cost associated with the optimal set of coefficients, which reflects the minimum of the function. The objective is to iteratively test different values for these coefficients, assess their corresponding costs, and then choose new coefficient values that yield a lower cost. By continuously repeating this method, you can approach the bottom of the bowl, identifying the coefficient values that ultimately reduce the cost to its minimum.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of iteratively adjusting coefficients in gradient descent to minimize cost, represented by a cost function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as it relates to finding the minimum of a cost function, represented by a bowl. The goal is to illustrate how starting from various random points on the inner surface of the bowl (the current cost) leads to lower costs through systematic adjustments of coefficients. The visualization should clearly show the journey towards the lowest point in the bowl (the optimal coefficients), as well as the cost associated with different coefficient sets. \n\nA suitable visualization style could include a 3D diagram of a bowl with arrows showing paths from different starting points to the minimum, alongside corresponding cost indicators at various points. This depiction will help clarify the cause-effect relationship between adjusting coefficients and reducing costs, highlighting both the sequential process of testing and adjusting as well as a comparative analysis of costs. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of how the iterative nature of gradient descent functions to minimize cost, allowing them to visualize the dynamic relationship between coefficients and the cost function clearly.",
