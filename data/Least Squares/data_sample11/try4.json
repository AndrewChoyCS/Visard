    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle \n**The projection of a vector onto a subspace and its implications for finding least squares solutions when the vector is not in the subspace.**\n\n### Visualization Query \nCreate a visualization to explain the process of projecting a vector \u00afb onto a column space Col(A) to derive the closest approximation Ax\u02c6 and the steps involved in formulating this projection without directly computing it. The goal is to illustrate the concept of least squares solutions when \u00afb is outside Col(A) and to highlight the relationship between the vectors involved: the original vector \u00afb, its projection PrCol(A) \u00afb, and the resulting vector Ax\u02c6. This visualization should clearly depict the geometrical representation of the projection, showcasing the angle between the vectors and the orthogonal relationships to emphasize the least squares principle.\n\n### Visual Elements \n1. **Components**: Use arrows to represent \u00afb, the projection PrCol(A) \u00afb, and the resulting vector Ax\u02c6. Include a dashed line to show the shortest distance (orthogonal component) from \u00afb to Col(A).\n2. **Diagrams**: Illustrate the column space Col(A) as a plane and position \u00afb outside this plane, underscoring the concept of approximation.\n3. **Color Coding**: Use distinct colors for \u00afb, PrCol(A) \u00afb, and Ax\u02c6 to facilitate visual differentiation and understanding.\n\n### Educational Outcomes\nThis visualization will enhance understanding by clearly displaying how the process of projection works in the context of least squares, allowing learners to grasp the relationships between the vectors and comprehend the geometric interpretation behind the calculations. By illustrating the relationships visually, learners will better appreciate the impact of vector projections on solution approaches in linear algebra and applications such as regression analysis.",
