    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\nThe essential principle is the projection of a vector \u00afb that is not in the column space of a matrix A onto the closest point in that column space, represented by PrCol(A) \u00afb, and the implications this has for finding a solution to Ax\u02c6.\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of vector projection in the context of least squares approximation. The goal is to illustrate how a vector \u00afb, which lies outside the column space of a matrix A, can be projected onto the column space to find the nearest point PrCol(A) \u00afb. This visualization should clarify the relationship between \u00afb, Col(A), and the approximated solution Ax\u02c6. \n\nThe visualization could incorporate a diagram showing the 3D space where \u00afb and Col(A) exist, along with arrows representing the projection process, highlighting both the original vector and its projection. It should also depict the resulting system and the solution represented by Ax\u02c6, emphasizing cause-effect relationships between \u00afb and the approximated solution. \n\nThis will help learners grasp the concept of least squares by visually showcasing how the projection minimizes the distance to achieve the best approximation, reinforcing core ideas of linear algebra and practical applications. \n\n**Learning Objective:** \nDeeply understand the geometric interpretation of vector projection within the least squares framework, enabling students to connect abstract algebraic concepts with tangible visual representations.",
