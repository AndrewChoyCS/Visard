    "goal": "### Core Principle Extraction:\nThe core principle to visualize from the text is the concept of projecting a vector (\u00afb) onto a column space (Col(A)) and understanding how this projection helps in finding a solution (\u02c6x) that minimizes the distance between the actual vector (\u00afb) and the resultant vector (Ax\u02c6) which lies within the column space.\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of projecting a vector onto a column space in order to find an approximate solution in the context of Least Squares. The goal of the visualization is to clarify how the projection (PrCol(A) \u00afb) represents the closest point in Col(A) to the vector \u00afb, illustrating the idea that while \u00afb is not in Col(A), Ax\u02c6 created from the solution \u02c6x is the best approximation within that space. The visualization should include diagrams showcasing the original vector \u00afb, the column space Col(A), and the projected vector PrCol(A) \u00afb with arrows indicating distances and relationships.\n\nTo enhance understanding, the visual should employ an infographic style, clearly labeling all components and showcasing the distance minimization relationship between \u00afb and the projection onto Col(A). This aids in understanding the process of finding solutions in Least Squares, emphasizing how projection is a key tool for dealing with vectors not contained in the column space.\n\n### Educational Objective:\nThe objective is to foster a deep understanding of the projection concept by illustrating its role in solving least squares problems, highlighting the mechanics of how projection minimizes the residual error between the actual vector and its best approximation in the column space. This understanding of relationships and processes is crucial for learners engaging with matrix computations and optimization techniques.",
