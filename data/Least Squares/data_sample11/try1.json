    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The projection of a vector that is not contained within the column space of a matrix onto that column space, specifically illustrating the process and implications of obtaining an approximate solution.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of projecting a vector (\u00afb) that lies outside the column space (Col(A)) of a matrix (A) onto Col(A). The goal is to illustrate how the projection (PrCol(A) \u00afb) provides the closest approximation within the column space and allows us to derive the solution vector (\u02c6x) for the equation Ax\u02c6 = PrCol(A) \u00afb. This visualization should emphasize the relationship between \u00afb, Col(A), and the resultant projection while also highlighting the challenges of computing the projection in larger matrices. \n\nThe visualization may take the form of a diagram or infographic that clearly shows the original vector \u00afb, the relevant column space Col(A), the projection PrCol(A) \u00afb, and how these components interact. By integrating labeled geometric representations, arrows, and color coding to indicate relationships, the visual will help facilitate a deeper understanding of the core concept of least squares approximation in linear algebra.\n\n**Objective:** This visualization aims to deepen students' understanding of how projections are utilized to achieve solutions in linear systems, particularly in the context of least squares. It seeks to clarify the importance of geometric representation in algebraic concepts and enhance retention through visual learning strategies.",
