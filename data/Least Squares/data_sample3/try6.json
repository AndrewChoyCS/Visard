    "data": "Let\u2019s look at the method of least squares from another perspective. Imagine that you\u2019ve plotted some data using a scatterplot, and that you fit a line for the mean of Y through the data. Let\u2019s lock this line in place, and attach springs between the data points and the line. Some of the data points are further from the mean line, so these springs are stretched more than others. The springs that are stretched the furthest exert the greatest force on the line. What if we unlock this mean line, and let it rotate freely around the mean of Y? The forces on the springs balance, rotating the line. The line rotates until the overall force on the line is minimized. The are some cool physics at play, involving the relationship between force and the energy needed to pull a spring a given distance. It turns out that minimizing the overall energy in the springs is equivalent to fitting a regression line using the method of least squares.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\nThe relationship between the distance of data points from the mean regression line and the forces (or \"springs\") that adjust the line's position to minimize overall energy is a key element of the least squares method.\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the method of least squares through a spring model.** The visualization should illustrate a scatterplot with a regression line fitted to the data, alongside spring-like connections between each data point and the line. Aspects to highlight include how the length of each spring correlates with the distance of the data points from the line and how the line rotates until the overall force exerted by the springs is minimized. \n\nUse a combination of diagrams and animated components that show the springs expanding and contracting as the line rotates, effectively conveying the idea of force balance. The key educational outcomes should focus on understanding how variations in data affect the regression line placement and the physical analogy of minimizing energy through the spring system. \n\nThis visualization should promote an understanding of the proportional relationship between the distances (errors) and their impact on the regression line's position, deepening learners' grasp of regression analysis and the concept of least squares fitting.",
