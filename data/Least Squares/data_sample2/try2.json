    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of finding the best approximation \\( \\hat{x} \\) such that \\( A\\hat{x} \\) is as close as possible to the vector \\( \\bar{b} \\), despite \\( \\bar{b} \\) not being in the column space \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\), and the challenges associated with projecting \\( \\bar{b} \\) onto \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\) to obtain \\( \\text{PrCol(A)} \\bar{b} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of projecting a vector \\( \\bar{b} \\) onto the column space \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\) and the subsequent derivation of the best approximation \\( \\hat{x} \\) that satisfies the equation \\( A\\hat{x} = \\text{PrCol(A)} \\bar{b} \\). \n\nThe goal of the visualization is to illustrate the geometric relationship between the vector \\( \\bar{b} \\) and the column space \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\), highlighting the projection of \\( \\bar{b} \\) onto this space and the resulting point \\( \\text{PrCol(A)} \\bar{b} \\). This should include a depiction of the challenges in calculating the projection, particularly when \\( A \\) is large, and how we can find \\( \\hat{x} \\) without explicit projection.\n\nThe visualization should take the form of a clear diagram that shows the vectors \\( \\bar{b} \\), \\( A\\hat{x} \\), and \\( \\text{PrCol(A)} \\bar{b} \\) in a 2D or 3D space, using arrows to indicate directions and distances. Analyzing these spatial relationships will deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of the Least Squares concept and its practical challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to facilitate a deep understanding of how the projection of a vector onto a space informs the solution of linear equations in the context of Least Squares, emphasizing the relationship between the original vector, its projection, and the resultant approximation. This visualization should help students grasp the geometric intuition behind these operations, thereby enhancing their overall comprehension of linear algebra concepts related to least squares fitting and approximation.",
