    "data": "Let \ud835\udc34 be an \ud835\udc5a\u00d7\ud835\udc5b matrix and let \ud835\udc4f be a vector in \u211d\ud835\udc5a. A least-squares solution to the equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f is a vector \ud835\udc65\u0302 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b such that the distance \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302) is less than or equal to \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65) for any other vector \ud835\udc65 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b. The set Col(\ud835\udc34) includes all vectors that can be represented in the form of \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Here, distance between the two vectors \ud835\udc63 and \ud835\udc64 is defined as \u2016\ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc64\u2016. According to Definition 6.1.2 in Section 6.1, the term \u201cleast Squares\u201d stems from the concept that dist(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65)=\u2016\ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302\u2016 represents the square root of the summation of the squares of the components constituting the vector \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302. Consequently, a least-squares solution irrevocably minimizes the cumulative squares of the deviations between the components of vector \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302 and \ud835\udc4f. In primary terms, this solution approximates the equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f most effectively, accessing minimal values fluidly regarding the squares of deviations between \u211d\ud835\udc4f and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Hence, the vector akin to \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65 that is most proximate to \ud835\udc4f effectively corresponds to the orthogonal projection of \ud835\udc4f onto the column space Col(\ud835\udc34), symbolized as \ud835\udc4fCol(\ud835\udc34).",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The least-squares solution minimizes the distance between a vector \\( b \\) and the column space represented by the matrix \\( A \\), effectively finding the orthogonal projection of \\( b \\) onto the column space Col(\ud835\udc34).\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of least-squares solutions and the orthogonal projection of a vector \\( b \\) onto the column space of a matrix \\( A \\). The goal is to visually represent how the least-squares solution, denoted as \\( \\hat{x} \\), minimizes the distance between the vector \\( b \\) and the vectors in the column space Col(A).\n\nThe visualization should clearly depict the vector \\( b \\), the matrix \\( A \\), and the resulting projection of \\( b \\) onto the column space Col(A). Use a diagram that illustrates the geometric relationship, showing \\( b \\), the projection \\( A\\hat{x} \\), and the direct line measuring the distance, which highlights the minimized sum of squared deviations. \n\nThis graphic aims to deepen the learner's understanding by illustrating the relationships between the vectors and spaces involved, emphasizing how the least-squares solution represents the optimal approximation of the equation \\( Ax = b \\). The expected educational outcome is for learners to grasp the concept of orthogonal projection in the context of least squares, as well as to visualize how the solution minimizes the cumulative squared distance.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners should be able to accurately explain how least-squares solutions function, understand the significance of orthogonal projections in this context, and effectively communicate the geometric relationships involved in minimizing the error between the vector \\( b \\) and the column space of \\( A \\).",
