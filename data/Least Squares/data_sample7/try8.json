A least-squares solution to the equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f is a vector \ud835\udc65\u0302 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b such that the distance \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302) is less than or equal to \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65) for any other vector \ud835\udc65 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b. The set Col(\ud835\udc34) includes all vectors that can be represented in the form of \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Here, distance between the two vectors \ud835\udc63 and \ud835\udc64 is defined as \u2016\ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc64\u2016. According to Definition 6.1.2 in Section 6.1, the term \u201cleast Squares\u201d stems from the concept that dist(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65)=\u2016\ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302\u2016 represents the square root of the summation of the squares of the components constituting the vector \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302. Consequently, a least-squares solution irrevocably minimizes the cumulative squares of the deviations between the components of vector \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302 and \ud835\udc4f. In primary terms, this solution approximates the equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f most effectively, accessing minimal values fluidly regarding the squares of deviations between \u211d\ud835\udc4f and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Hence, the vector akin to \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65 that is most proximate to \ud835\udc4f effectively corresponds to the orthogonal projection of \ud835\udc4f onto the column space Col(\ud835\udc34), symbolized as \ud835\udc4fCol(\ud835\udc34).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of the least-squares solution as the orthogonal projection of the vector \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) onto the column space \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\).** \n\nThe visualization should illustrate the mathematical relationship between the vector \\( \\mathbf{b} \\), the column space \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\), and the least-squares solution \\( \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\). Utilizing a combination of a diagram and a 3D plot, the diagram will show \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) and its projection onto \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\), highlighting the distance between \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) and the point in \\( \\text{Col}(A) \\) that minimizes this distance. The plot should clearly label the relevant components, including the vectors involved and their distances.\n\nThe key educational outcomes expected from this visualization are: \n1. Comprehension of how the least-squares solution minimizes the distance \\( \\| \\mathbf{b} - A\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\| \\).\n2. Understanding of the geometric interpretation of vectors in \\( \\mathbb{R}^m \\) and their projections onto subspaces.\n\nThis visual representation will deepen understanding by making explicit the relationships between the vectors, demonstrating how the least-squares solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection, thus enabling learners to grasp the fundamental essence of minimizing squared deviations in a geometric context.",
