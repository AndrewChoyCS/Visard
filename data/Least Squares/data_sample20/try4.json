    "data": "Consider a situation where you are given a collection of N vectors, denoted as {~x1, \u2026, ~xN }, each having a dimensionality of d, along with a scalar observation linked to each, represented as {y1, \u2026, yN }. We seek to develop a linear function that can effectively predict the y value given the input vector ~x. In other words, we aim to find a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w>~xi. Specifically, we want to minimize the total squared prediction error. To achieve this, we will seek the ~w that minimizes the overall squared error defined mathematically as: \u03a3N i=1(yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of orthogonality in the context of least squares regression.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the residual error vector (Y - Xw) must be orthogonal to each column of the design matrix X, emphasizing the minimization of prediction error in a multi-dimensional space. This concept can be clarified through a diagram that shows the relationship between the observed values (Y), the predicted linear combination (Xw), and the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by the columns of X. \n\nUsing graphical elements like arrows to represent vectors and a shaded area to denote the subspace will help learners visually grasp the perpendicularity principle, thereby enhancing their understanding of how the least squares solution is derived. The expected educational outcomes include a deep comprehension of the least squares methodology, improved ability to interpret geometric relationships in regression analysis, and a stronger foundation in understanding how high-dimensional data can be fitted using linear models.\n\n### Objective: \nStudents will demonstrate a fundamental understanding of orthogonality in regression by accurately depicting and explaining how the optimal weight vector minimizes residual errors through orthogonal projections in a geometrical space.",
