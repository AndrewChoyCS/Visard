We seek to develop a linear function that can effectively predict the y value given the input vector ~x. In other words, we aim to find a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w>~xi. Specifically, we want to minimize the total squared prediction error. To achieve this, we will seek the ~w that minimizes the overall squared error defined mathematically as: \u03a3N i=1(yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2. We can express this in vector format for simplicity. Let Y represent a stack of observations in a vector form {yi}, and X represent a matrix made up of the rows of the vectors {~xi}\u2014this matrix is often referred to as the design matrix: \n\nY = \n[ y1 \n\u2026 \nyN ].\u00a0\n\nX = \n[ \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 \n\u2026 \n\u2014 ~xN \u2014 ]. \n\nThis allows us to rewrite the squared error from before as the norm of the residual error expressed via vectors: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||\u00b2.

Consequently, what least squares regression fundamentally attempts is to compute a linear combination from these vectors, X ~w, that approximates Y as closely as achievable. Mathematically, this optimal linear combination can be determined by visualizing a perpendicular drop from Y straight down to the defined subspace spanned by {X1, \u2026, Xd}. This situation implies that the residual error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) must be orthogonal to each column of X. This can be formalized as (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, for every column j={1...d}.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared prediction error in least squares regression.** The visualization should depict the relationship between the observed data vector \\(Y\\) and the linear combination of input vectors \\(X \\mathbf{w}\\), emphasizing how the goal is to minimize the residual error, represented by the orthogonal distance between \\(Y\\) and the subspace spanned by the columns of \\(X\\). \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a 3D graph that illustrates the \\(N\\)-dimensional observation vector \\(Y\\), alongside the \\(d\\)-dimensional subspace created by the input vectors \\(X\\). It should clearly indicate the direction of the perpendicular drop from \\(Y\\) to the subspace, thereby showing how the residual error vector \\((Y - X \\mathbf{w})\\) is orthogonal to each column of \\(X\\). \n\nThis visual representation will help learners grasp the underlying geometry of least squares regression and the importance of orthogonality, ultimately enhancing their understanding of how optimal weight vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) can be derived. The objective is to foster a deep comprehension of the relationships between input vectors, observed outcomes, and residual errors, reinforcing the conceptual framework of least squares regression in an engaging way.",
