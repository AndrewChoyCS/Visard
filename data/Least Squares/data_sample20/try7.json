    "data": "Consider a situation where you are given a collection of N vectors, denoted as {~x1, \u2026, ~xN }, each having a dimensionality of d, along with a scalar observation linked to each, represented as {y1, \u2026, yN }. We seek to develop a linear function that can effectively predict the y value given the input vector ~x. In other words, we aim to find a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w>~xi. Specifically, we want to minimize the total squared prediction error. To achieve this, we will seek the ~w that minimizes the overall squared error defined mathematically as: \u03a3N i=1(yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2. We can express this in vector format for simplicity. Let Y represent a stack of observations in a vector form {yi}, and X represent a matrix made up of the rows of the vectors {~xi}\u2014this matrix is often referred to as the design matrix: \n\nY = \n[ y1 \n\u2026 \nyN ].\u00a0\n\nX = \n[ \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 \n\u2026 \n\u2014 ~xN \u2014 ]. \n\nThis allows us to rewrite the squared error from before as the norm of the residual error expressed via vectors: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||\u00b2.

Let\u2019s define {Xj} as the jth column of X, so we have:\n\nX =\n[ X1 \n\u2026 \nXd ]. \n\nThe individual columns of X generate a d-dimensional subspace embedded in the broader N-dimensional realm where vector Y resides. Typically, Y doesn't lie squarely within this subspace. Consequently, what least squares regression fundamentally attempts is to compute a linear combination from these vectors, X ~w, that approximates Y as closely as achievable. Mathematically, this optimal linear combination can be determined by visualizing a perpendicular drop from Y straight down to the defined subspace spanned by {X1, \u2026, Xd}. This situation implies that the residual error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) must be orthogonal to each column of X. This can be formalized as (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, for every column j={1...d}.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of orthogonality in least squares regression.** The visualization should aim to clarify how the least squares method minimizes the squared error by ensuring that the residual error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) is orthogonal to the columns of the design matrix X. \n\nThis visualization could take the form of a diagram that illustrates the N-dimensional space of the observation vector Y and the d-dimensional subspace spanned by the columns of X. One side could depict a perpendicular drop from the point representing Y down to the nearest point in the subspace, representing the predicted values X ~w. Arrows and annotations should highlight the orthogonality condition, visually demonstrating that the angle between the residual vector and the columns of X is 90 degrees.\n\nBy visualizing these relationships, learners can better grasp how least squares regression works and the significance of the orthogonality condition, leading to improved understanding of how predictions are optimized. This visualization serves as a tool to enhance learners' ability to connect abstract mathematical concepts to geometric interpretations.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how the least squares regression method minimizes prediction error through orthogonality, recognizing the geometric interpretation of residuals and their relationship to the design matrix.",
