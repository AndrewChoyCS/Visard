We seek to develop a linear function that can effectively predict the y value given the input vector ~x. In other words, we aim to find a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w>~xi. Specifically, we want to minimize the total squared prediction error. To achieve this, we will seek the ~w that minimizes the overall squared error defined mathematically as: \u03a3N i=1(yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing the squared prediction error in least squares regression.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the weight vector \\( \\hat{w} \\) is estimated such that the residual error vector \\( (Y - X\\hat{w}) \\) is orthogonal to the columns of the design matrix \\( X \\). This visualization should clarify the relationship between the observed vector \\( Y \\), the predicted values \\( X\\hat{w} \\), and the concept of orthogonality, demonstrating how least squares regression finds the best approximation of \\( Y \\) within the subspace spanned by \\( X \\).\n\nThe recommended visualization style could be a multi-paneled diagram that shows the following: \n\n1. **Subspace Representation**: The \\( d \\)-dimensional subspace spanned by the columns of \\( X \\) represented in an \\( N \\)-dimensional space along with a graphical depiction of the observed vector \\( Y \\).\n2. **Perpendicular Drop**: An illustration showing a perpendicular drop from \\( Y \\) to the subspace, emphasizing the orthogonality of the residual error.\n3. **Equations**: Key mathematical expressions, such as \\( (Y - X\\hat{w})\\cdot X_j = 0 \\), seamlessly integrated into the visuals to show the algebraic relationships.\n\nThis visual aid will enhance learners' understanding by revealing how the least squares method attempts to minimize the squared differences between actual and predicted values, emphasizing how the geometry of the problem translates into algebraic formulations. By focusing on the relationships and orthogonality inherent in this statistical technique, learners can gain deeper insights into the principles underlying linear regression.\n\n**Learning Objective**: Learners will be able to clearly articulate how the minimization of squared errors in least squares regression results in an orthogonal relationship between the residual error vector and the columns of the design matrix, and they will effectively use this understanding to solve applied problems in regression analysis.",
