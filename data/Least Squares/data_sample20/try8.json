    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared error in least squares regression, particularly focusing on the orthogonality of the residual error vector to the columns of the design matrix.** \n\nThe visualization should illustrate the geometric relationship between the observed vector \\( Y \\), the predicted vector \\( X\\tilde{w} \\), and the residual error vector \\( (Y - X\\tilde{w}) \\). A 3D plot can effectively depict \\( Y \\) and \\( X\\tilde{w} \\) within a d-dimensional subspace, showcasing how the residual error vector drops perpendicularly to this subspace. By clearly marking the orthogonal relationship and the minimization of the squared distance, the visualization will highlight the core principle that the best linear approximation occurs when the residuals are orthogonal to the predictors.\n\n**Key Educational Outcomes:**\n- Understand the concept of orthogonality in the context of least squares regression.\n- Visualize how the minimization of residuals relates to the performance of the prediction model.\n- Grasp the geometric interpretation of the least squares solution, fostering deeper insights into regression analysis.\n\nThis visual will aid in comprehensively understanding how the components interact in the least squares framework, making the abstract concepts tangible through clear visual representation.",
