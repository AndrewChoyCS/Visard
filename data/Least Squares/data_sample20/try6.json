    "data": "Consider a situation where you are given a collection of N vectors, denoted as {~x1, \u2026, ~xN }, each having a dimensionality of d, along with a scalar observation linked to each, represented as {y1, \u2026, yN }. We seek to develop a linear function that can effectively predict the y value given the input vector ~x. In other words, we aim to find a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w>~xi. Specifically, we want to minimize the total squared prediction error. To achieve this, we will seek the ~w that minimizes the overall squared error defined mathematically as: \u03a3N i=1(yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2. We can express this in vector format for simplicity. Let Y represent a stack of observations in a vector form {yi}, and X represent a matrix made up of the rows of the vectors {~xi}\u2014this matrix is often referred to as the design matrix: \n\nY = \n[ y1 \n\u2026 \nyN ].\u00a0\n\nX = \n[ \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 \n\u2026 \n\u2014 ~xN \u2014 ]. \n\nThis allows us to rewrite the squared error from before as the norm of the residual error expressed via vectors: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||\u00b2. The formula to estimate the vector that minimizes the squared error\u2014dyed in a hat to signify it's an estimate taken from observations\u2014is: ~w = (X>X)\u207b\u00b9 (X>Y). \n\nAs for the first derivation that utilizes orthogonality, let's interpret the design matrix X as comprising its d columns instead of its N rows. Let\u2019s define {Xj} as the jth column of X, so we have:\n\nX =\n[ X1 \n\u2026 \nXd ]. \n\nThe individual columns of X generate a d-dimensional subspace embedded in the broader N-dimensional realm where vector Y resides. Typically, Y doesn't lie squarely within this subspace. Consequently, what least squares regression fundamentally attempts is to compute a linear combination from these vectors, X ~w, that approximates Y as closely as achievable. Mathematically, this optimal linear combination can be determined by visualizing a perpendicular drop from Y straight down to the defined subspace spanned by {X1, \u2026, Xd}. This situation implies that the residual error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) must be orthogonal to each column of X. This can be formalized as (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, for every column j={1...d}. When arranged as a matrix equation, this statement simplifies to: (Y \u2212 X ~w)>X = ~0, where ~0 is the vector originating from zeros.\n\nTo derive our intended expression for ~w, we can deduce that: (Y \u2212 X ~w)>X = Y>X \u2212 X>X~w = 0, leading through good algebraic forethought to: (X>X)~w = X>Y and yielding ~w = (X>X)\u207b\u00b9X>Y.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared error in least squares regression, particularly the orthogonality condition of the residual error vector.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the residual error vector\u2014defined as \\( Y - X\\hat{w} \\)\u2014is perpendicular to the columns of the design matrix \\( X \\). A flowchart-style diagram could be effective here, showing the relationship between the vectors \\( Y \\), \\( X\\hat{w} \\), and the residual error, visually depicting the orthogonal projection from \\( Y \\) down to the subspace spanned by the columns of \\( X \\).\n\nThis visualization should include arrows indicating directionality and orthogonality, with labels clearly defining each vector and their mathematical expressions. By visually demonstrating how the residual error behaves in relation to the defined subspace, learners will gain deeper insights into the significance of minimizing squared error in the context of linear regression. \n\n**Objective**: To enable learners to understand and visualize the fundamental concept of orthogonality in least squares regression, thereby developing a clear comprehension of how to interpret and apply the condition that the residuals must be orthogonal to the design matrix for optimal weight estimation.",
