    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The projection of a vector \\( \\bar{b} \\) onto the column space of a matrix \\( A \\) and the resultant relationship to the solution \\( \\hat{x} \\) that minimizes the distance to \\( \\bar{b} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of projecting a vector \\( \\bar{b} \\) onto the column space of a matrix \\( A \\) and determining the solution vector \\( \\hat{x} \\). The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how \\( \\hat{x} \\) minimizes the distance from \\( \\bar{b} \\) to the column space of \\( A \\), highlighting the significance of this projection process. Specifically, the visual should depict the vector \\( \\bar{b} \\), its projection \\( \\text{PrCol}(A) \\bar{b} \\), the line segment representing the distance being minimized, and the relationship to the solution \\( A\\hat{x} \\). \n\nUsing a combination of diagrams and graphs, the visualization should clearly show the interactions between these components while also labeling the vectors and spaces involved. This aids in clarifying the cause-effect relationship between the projection and the least squares solution. \n\n**Key Educational Outcomes:**\n1. Learners will grasp how vectors outside a column space relate to solutions within that space through projection.\n2. The visualization will illustrate the geometrical interpretation of least squares, making complex concepts tangible.\n3. It promotes understanding of the minimization process and the role of the projection in finding \\( \\hat{x} \\) in a visually intuitive way.\n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of vector projections in linear algebra, particularly how they relate to least squares optimization, through clear and engaging visual representations of spatial relationships and projection dynamics.",
