    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y. (8) So to summarize: the requirement that the residual errors Y \u2212 X ~w be orthogonal to the columns of X was all we needed to derive the optimal weight vector ~w.  ",
    "goal": "### Query for Visualization Expert\n\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of residual error in least squares regression and its orthogonality to the design matrix.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the vector \\(Y\\) representing the observations, the design matrix \\(X\\), and the estimated linear combination \\(X\\tilde{w}\\) relate geometrically in a multidimensional space. Specifically, it should depict the relationship where the residual error \\(Y - X\\tilde{w}\\) is orthogonal to every column of \\(X\\), illustrating the geometric significance of this principle.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a diagram showing \\(Y\\), \\(X\\tilde{w}\\), and the residual error vector, positioned in a 2D or 3D plane if appropriate, with arrows indicating their directions and a right angle demonstrating orthogonality. Additionally, the visualization should highlight how the weights \\(\\tilde{w}\\) optimize the fit to minimize the squared error.\n\nThis visual will aid in understanding the key relationship between the variables in least squares regression by providing a spatial context that reinforces how orthogonality leads to minimizing errors. \n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of the geometric interpretation of least squares regression, specifically how the requirement for the residual error to be orthogonal to the design matrix facilitates the derivation of the optimal weights.",
