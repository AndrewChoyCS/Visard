    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y. (8) So to summarize: the requirement that the residual errors Y \u2212 X ~w be orthogonal to the columns of X was all we needed to derive the optimal weight vector ~w.  ",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The orthogonality of the residual errors in Least Squares Regression, which ensures that the error vector (Y - X~w) is orthogonal to each column of the design matrix X.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the orthogonality concept in Least Squares Regression. The goal is to illustrate how the residual error vector (Y - X~w) relates to the columns of the design matrix X and demonstrate that this vector should be perpendicular to each column. This visualization should clarify the geometric interpretation of the least squares method, revealing how finding the optimal weight vector ~w minimizes the squared prediction error by ensuring orthogonality. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a 3D diagram showing the vectors Y, X~w, and the error vector (Y - X~w), highlighting the right angles using dashed lines. Using colors to differentiate these vectors will aid in understanding their relationships and the geometric configuration. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will develop a deep understanding of how the properties of orthogonality in the context of vector spaces underpin the least squares regression method. They will grasp the significance of minimizing residual errors to achieve accurate predictions, enhancing their ability to apply these concepts in practical situations.",
