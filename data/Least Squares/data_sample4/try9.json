    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y. (8) So to summarize: the requirement that the residual errors Y \u2212 X ~w be orthogonal to the columns of X was all we needed to derive the optimal weight vector ~w.  ",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of orthogonality in least squares regression.** This visualization should illustrate how the optimal weight vector \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}\\) minimizes the squared error by ensuring that the residual error vector \\((Y - X\\hat{\\mathbf{w}})\\) is orthogonal to each column of the design matrix \\(X\\). The goal is to clarify the geometric relationship between the observed outputs \\(Y\\), the predicted outputs \\(X\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}\\), and the orthogonality condition, showing how minimizing the distance between these vectors forms a right angle.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a 3D diagram or infographic that displays the vector \\(Y\\), the subspace spanned by the columns of \\(X\\), and the residual error vector, clearly indicating their relationships. It should highlight the cause-effect relationship of how the optimal linear combination is derived by projecting \\(Y\\) onto the column space of \\(X\\), using visual markers such as right angles to denote orthogonality. \n\n**Educational Outcome:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will gain a deep understanding of the spatial geometry underlying least squares regression, particularly how achieving orthogonality in the residuals provides insight into the optimization process, reinforcing the importance of this condition in deriving \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}\\) and enhancing their grasp of regression analysis.",
