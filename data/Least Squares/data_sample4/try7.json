    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y. (8) So to summarize: the requirement that the residual errors Y \u2212 X ~w be orthogonal to the columns of X was all we needed to derive the optimal weight vector ~w.  ",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The relationship between the observation vector \\( Y \\) and the design matrix \\( X \\) in the context of minimizing squared prediction errors in least squares regression, and the geometric interpretation of the orthogonality of the residual errors.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the geometric interpretation of least squares regression, particularly how the vector \\( Y \\) relates to the subspace spanned by the columns of the design matrix \\( X \\). The visualization should illustrate the concept of projecting the vector \\( Y \\) onto the subspace formed by \\( X \\), highlighting the optimal linear combination represented by \\( X\\mathbf{w} \\) and demonstrating that the residual error \\( (Y - X\\mathbf{w}) \\) is orthogonal to the columns of \\( X \\). Use a 3D diagram to depict the dimensions of the residual error, the observed vector \\( Y \\), and the regression subspace, clearly labeling each component. \n\nThis visualization will deepen understanding of why the least squares solution minimizes the squared error by showcasing the relationships and orthogonality crucial to the regression process. Students should emerge with a clear grasp of how the projection method forms the basis for finding optimal weights in regression.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will demonstrate a deep understanding of the geometric interpretation of least squares regression by explaining how \\( Y \\) is projected onto the subspace spanned by \\( X \\) and discussing the implications of orthogonal residuals in minimizing prediction error. This understanding will enhance their ability to analyze real-world data sets through the lens of regression analysis.",
