    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y. (8) So to summarize: the requirement that the residual errors Y \u2212 X ~w be orthogonal to the columns of X was all we needed to derive the optimal weight vector ~w.  ",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of residual error in least squares regression and its relationship to the orthogonality of the error vector.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the residual error vector \\( (Y - X \\mathbf{w}) \\) is orthogonal to the columns of the design matrix \\( X \\), thereby providing insight into the geometric interpretation of least squares regression. This concept is crucial for understanding why the closest approximation of \\( Y \\) in the subspace spanned by the columns of \\( X \\) corresponds to minimizing squared error. \n\nThe visualization should depict the N-dimensional space containing vector \\( Y \\) and the d-dimensional subspace formed by the columns of \\( X \\). It could use a 3D diagram to show the projection of \\( Y \\) onto this subspace, complemented by arrows indicating the residual error vector and its orthogonal relationships with each column of \\( X \\). \n\nThis visual aids in understanding the geometric aspects of the least squares process by clearly showing the spatial relationships involved, emphasizing how the orthogonality condition leads to the optimal weight vector \\( \\mathbf{w} \\). \n\n**Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of how minimizing residuals in least squares regression results in orthogonal relationships between error vectors and predictor variables, facilitating clearer conceptualization of error minimization in predictive modeling.",
