    "data": "Suppose someone hands you a stack of N vectors, {~x1, . . . ~xN }, each of dimension d, and an scalar observation associated with each one, {y1, . . . , yN }. In other words, the data now come in pairs (~xi , yi), where each pair has one vector (known as the input, the regressor, or the predictor) and a scalar (known as the output or dependent variable). Suppose we would like to estimate a linear function that allows us to predict y from ~x as well as possible: in other words, we\u2019d like a weight vector ~w such that yi \u2248 ~w >~xi . Specifically, we\u2019d like to minimize the squared prediction error, so we\u2019d like to find the ~w that minimizes squared error = X N i=1 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w) 2 (1) We\u2019re going to write this as a vector equation to make it easier to derive the solution. Let Y be a vector composed of the stacked observations {yi}, and let X be the vector whose rows are the vectors {~xi} (which is known as the design matrix): Y = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 y1 . . . yN \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 \u2014 ~x1 \u2014 . . . \u2014 ~xN \u2014 \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb Then we can rewrite the squared error given above as the squared vector norm of the residual error between Y and X ~w: squared error = ||Y \u2212 X ~w||2 (2) The solution (stated here without proof): the vector that minimizes the above squared error (which we equip with a hat \u02c6~w to denote the fact that it is an estimate recovered from data) is: ~w = (X>X) \u22121 (X>Y ). 2 Derivation 1: using orthogonality I will provide two derivations of the above formula, though we will only have time to discuss the first one (which is a little bit easier) in class. It has the added advantage that it gives us some insight into the geometry of the problem. 1 Let\u2019s think about the design matrix X in terms of its d columns instead of its N rows. Let {Xj} denote the j 0 th column, i.e., X = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8f0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xd \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fb (3) The columns of X span a d-dimensional subspace within the larger N-dimensional vector space that contains the vector Y . Generally Y does not lie exactly within this subspace. Least squares regression is therefore trying to find the linear combination of these vectors, X ~w, that gets as close to possible to Y . What we know about the optimal linear combination is that it corresponds to dropping a line down from Y to the subspace spanned by {X1, . . . XD} at a right angle. In other words, the error vector (Y \u2212 X ~w) (also known as the residual error) should be orthogonal to every column of X: (Y \u2212 X ~w) \u00b7 Xj = 0, (4) for all columns j = 1 up to j = d. Written as a matrix equation this means: (Y \u2212 X ~w) >X = ~0 (5) where ~0 is d-component vector of zeros. We should quickly be able to see that solving this for ~w gives us the solution we were looking for: X>(Y \u2212 X ~w) = X>Y \u2212 X>X ~w = 0 (6) =\u21d2 (X>X) ~w = X>Y (7) =\u21d2 ~w = (X>X) \u22121X>Y.

    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\nThe concept of minimizing the squared prediction error in a least squares regression context, particularly focusing on how the residual error vector should be orthogonal to every column of the design matrix.\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the geometric interpretation of least squares regression.** The goal is to vividly illustrate how the residual error vector (Y - Xw) is orthogonal to the columns of the design matrix X. This visualization should include a representation of the d-dimensional subspace spanned by the columns of X and the relationship between the vector Y, the estimated vector Xw, and the residual error. Using a 2D or 3D diagram will help clarify the spatial relationships and angles involved. The expected educational outcomes include a solid understanding of how least squares regression seeks to find the optimal linear combination of predictor vectors to minimize the prediction error and the significance of orthogonality in this context.\n\n### Visualization Style:\nChoose a diagram that clearly labels key elements such as the vectors Y, Xw, and the residual error (Y - Xw). Adding color coding or shaded areas will enhance the visual clarity of the orthogonality concept. By presenting these relationships visually, learners can internalize the geometric basis of the least squares method, enhancing their ability to apply these concepts practically.\n\n### Objective:\nThe objective is to achieve a deep and crucial understanding of the geometric interpretation of least squares regression by demonstrating the orthogonality condition of the residual error vector to the predictor columns, enabling learners to visualize and conceptualize the solutions to linear regression problems effectively.",
