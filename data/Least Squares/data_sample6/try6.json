    "data": "Let \ud835\udc34 be an \ud835\udc5a\u00d7\ud835\udc5b matrix, and let \ud835\udc4f be a vector in \u211d\ud835\udc5a. A least-squares solution to the matrix equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f is denoted as \ud835\udc65\u0302 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b, and it satisfies the condition that dist(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302)\u2264dist(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65) for any other vectors \ud835\udc65 in \u211d\ud835\udc5b. The column space, Col(\ud835\udc34), represents all vectors manifested as \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Recall that the distance between two vectors \ud835\udc63 and \ud835\udc64 can be defined as dist(\ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc64)=\u2016\ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc64\u2016. The term \u201cleast squares\u201d signifies that dist(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65)=\u2016\ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302\u2016 expresses the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of the vector \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302. Essentially, finding a least-squares solution entails minimizing the sum of squared differences between the elements of \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65\u0302 and \ud835\udc4f. Accordingly, this approach seeks to invalidate the equation \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f as accurately as possible by cutting down the squared discrepancies \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65. Therefore, the optimal vector of the form \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65 that approximates \ud835\udc4f is represented as the orthogonal projection of \ud835\udc4f on Col(\ud835\udc34), indicated as \ud835\udc4fCol(\ud835\udc34).",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of the least-squares solution as the orthogonal projection of a vector \\( b \\) onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\).** This visualization should illustrate how the vector \\( b \\) relates to the matrix \\( A \\) and its column space, showing the minimum distance achieved by the least-squares solution \\( \\hat{x} \\). It should highlight the relationship between \\( b \\), the approximation \\( A\\hat{x} \\), and their distances, using geometric interpretations such as a 2D or 3D diagram. \n\nThe visual should include arrows indicating the orthogonal projection of \\( b \\) onto \\( Col(A) \\) and demonstrate how this projection minimizes the Euclidean distance, \\( dist(b, A\\hat{x}) \\). Using a diagram with labeled axes and clear notation will aid learners in grasping the core principle of minimizing squared discrepancies, reinforcing their understanding of how the least-squares approach finds the best possible solution in a visual and intuitive manner.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually comprehend how the least-squares solution functions as the orthogonal projection of a target vector onto a defined column space, enhancing their understanding of distance minimization in linear equations and the practical application of these concepts in data modeling.",
