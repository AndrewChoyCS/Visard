    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\nThe principle of projecting a vector \\(\\bar{b}\\) onto the column space of a matrix \\(A\\) and finding an estimate \\(\\hat{x}\\) such that the product \\(A\\hat{x}\\) is as close as possible to \\(\\bar{b}\\), highlights the iterative relationship between the desired result and the geometric interpretation of least squares.\n\n### Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the process of projecting the vector \\(\\bar{b}\\) onto the column space of matrix \\(A\\) and how this relates to finding the estimate \\(\\hat{x}\\).** The visualization should clarify the concept of projection in the context of least squares, illustrating how a vector outside the column space can be approximated by the closest point within it. It should show the geometric relationship between \\(\\bar{b}\\), its projection \\(Pr_{\\text{Col}(A)}\\bar{b}\\), and the resulting estimate \\(\\hat{x}\\), using arrows to denote direction and length to signify accuracy.\n\nThe visualization can be an infographic or a diagram that incorporates a 2D or 3D plot of the column space of \\(A\\), the vector \\(\\bar{b}\\), and its projection. By visually highlighting the projection\u2019s perpendicularity to the column space and the Euclidean distance to \\(\\bar{b}\\), learners will better grasp the significance of minimizing error in the least squares framework. \n\n### Educational Objective\nThe objective is to foster a deep understanding of how geometric interpretation underpins the least squares method, allowing learners to appreciate the necessity of projections in solving overdetermined systems, especially when dealing with large matrices. Visualization of these relationships will enhance their spatial reasoning regarding linear algebra concepts, creating a more intuitive connection between abstract mathematical ideas and practical analytical methods.",
