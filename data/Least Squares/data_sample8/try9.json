    "data": "Let \\( A \\) be a matrix of size \\( m \\times n \\) and \\( b \\) be a vector belonging to \\( \\mathbb{R}^m \\). A least-squares solution corresponds to a vector \\( \\hat{x} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) which minimizes the distance defined by \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) \\leq dist(b, A x) \\) for each vector \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\). The column space we refer to as \\( Col(A) \\) consists of all vectors expressible in the form \\( A x \\).

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain** the core concept of the least-squares solution in the context of minimizing distance between a vector \\( b \\) and its closest approximation \\( A \\hat{x} \\) in the column space \\( Col(A) \\). The visualization should illustrate how the orthogonal projection of \\( b \\) onto \\( Col(A) \\) is the vector \\( b_{Col(A)} \\), which minimizes the Euclidean distance \\( \\| b - A \\hat{x} \\| \\). \n\nTo clarify this concept, the visualization could be presented as a 3D graph where the axes represent the dimensions of the matrix \\( A \\) and \\( b \\). The graph should include the column space as a plane or surface, show the vector \\( b \\), and depict the points \\( A \\hat{x} \\) and \\( b_{Col(A)} \\) with a clear indication of the distances involved. Using arrows to denote distances and including annotations will allow learners to comprehend the key relationships and how \\( \\hat{x} \\) plays a central role in minimizing these distances.\n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of how least-squares solutions operate in geometric terms. This visualization helps learners grasp the essential idea of projection in linear algebra, the meaning behind minimizing squared distances, and the interplay between the vector space and its projections. By focusing on the spatial relationships and causal connections illustrated in the graph, students will be encouraged to form a conceptual mental picture of the least-squares methodology, facilitating better retention and application of the principle.",
