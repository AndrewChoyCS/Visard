    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The concept of orthogonal projection of the vector \\( b \\) onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\) as part of the least-squares solution process.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the orthogonal projection of the vector \\( b \\) onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\) within the context of least-squares solutions. The goal is to depict how the least-squares solution \\( \\hat{x} \\) minimizes the distance between \\( b \\) and the closest representation in the form \\( A \\hat{x} \\). This visualization should clarify the relationship between \\( b \\), \\( Col(A) \\), and the projection \\( b_{Col(A)} \\), demonstrating the geometric interpretation of least squares.\n\nThe visualization should include a 2D or 3D diagram showing the vector \\( b \\), the column space \\( Col(A) \\), and the orthogonal projection \\( b_{Col(A)} \\). Labels should clearly define these components and illustrate the distance minimization process through a right angle formed between the vector \\( b \\) and the projection line. \n\nBy integrating these visual elements, the learner will gain a deeper insight into how least-squares solutions relate to minimizing discrepancies and will understand the geometric interpretation of the column space and projections. \n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of how the orthogonal projection of a vector onto a column space minimizes distance disparities in least-squares problems, enhancing their ability to visualize and conceptualize multi-dimensional data relationships in the context of linear algebra.",
