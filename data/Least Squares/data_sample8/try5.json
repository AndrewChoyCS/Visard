    "data": "Let \\( A \\) be a matrix of size \\( m \\times n \\) and \\( b \\) be a vector belonging to \\( \\mathbb{R}^m \\). A least-squares solution corresponds to a vector \\( \\hat{x} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) which minimizes the distance defined by \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) \\leq dist(b, A x) \\) for each vector \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\). The column space we refer to as \\( Col(A) \\) consists of all vectors expressible in the form \\( A x \\). The distance between vectors \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) is given by \\( dist(v, w) = \\| v - w \\| \\); this refers to the concept detailed in Definition 6.1.2 of Section 6.1 and implies that \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) = \\| b - A \\hat{x} \\| \\), revealing that the \u201cleast squares\u201d terminology stems from the squared summation of the entries within the vector \\( b - A \\hat{x} \\) ( ).

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of the least-squares solution and its relationship to orthogonal projection.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how a vector \\( b \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^m \\) is approximated by the nearest point in the column space \\( Col(A) \\) of a matrix \\( A \\), emphasizing the process of minimizing the distance \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) \\). The visualization should clearly depict the vector \\( b \\), the column space spanned by \\( A \\), and the projection of \\( b \\) onto this space, denoted as \\( b_{Col(A)} \\).\n\nTo achieve this, a diagrammatic style would be most effective, incorporating labeled arrows to indicate distances and projections. It should visually demonstrate the orthogonality between the vector \\( b - A \\hat{x} \\) and the column space \\( Col(A) \\), reinforcing the concept of minimization through the relationship of these elements. The visual should highlight the key educational outcome of understanding how least-squares solutions provide the best linear approximation of a given vector in the context of linear transformations.\n\n**Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of the least-squares principle by visualizing the orthogonal projection and minimizing distances, enabling them to effectively grasp the mechanics of how least-squares solutions function in approximating vectors.",
