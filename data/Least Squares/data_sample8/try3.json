    "data": "Let \\( A \\) be a matrix of size \\( m \\times n \\) and \\( b \\) be a vector belonging to \\( \\mathbb{R}^m \\). A least-squares solution corresponds to a vector \\( \\hat{x} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) which minimizes the distance defined by \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) \\leq dist(b, A x) \\) for each vector \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\). The column space we refer to as \\( Col(A) \\) consists of all vectors expressible in the form \\( A x \\). The distance between vectors \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) is given by \\( dist(v, w) = \\| v - w \\| \\); this refers to the concept detailed in Definition 6.1.2 of Section 6.1 and implies that \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) = \\| b - A \\hat{x} \\| \\), revealing that the \u201cleast squares\u201d terminology stems from the squared summation of the entries within the vector \\( b - A \\hat{x} \\) ( ). Thus, a least-squares solution aims to minimize the accumulated squares of the disparities between the entries of \\( A \\hat{x} \\) and \\( b \\), meaning it achieves the closest possible representation of \\( b \\) in relation to \\( A x \\).

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of least-squares solutions and the orthogonal projection of vector \\( b \\) onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\).** The visualization should depict matrix \\( A \\), vector \\( b \\), and the resulting least-squares solution \\( \\hat{x} \\). It should illustrate how the vector \\( b \\) can be represented as the sum of its orthogonal projection onto \\( Col(A) \\) and a residual error vector. Use a diagram with vectors in a 2D or 3D space, indicating the relationships between \\( b \\), \\( A \\hat{x} \\), and the projection. \n\nThe goal of this visual is to clarify how the least-squares approach minimizes the distance \\( \\| b - A \\hat{x} \\| \\), highlighting the cause-effect relationship between the projection and the minimization of error. By showing the orthogonal projection distinctly, learners can better grasp how the closest representation of \\( b \\) relates to \\( Col(A) \\) and how the squared distances contribute to finding the optimal solution. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of how least-squares solutions operate geometrically, recognizing the significance of orthogonal projection and error minimization in representing data points through a given matrix. This will foster a tangible comprehension of the underlying mathematical concepts that drive least-squares methodologies.",
