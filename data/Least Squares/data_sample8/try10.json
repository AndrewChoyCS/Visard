    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the process of finding a least-squares solution in the context of orthogonal projection.** The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the relationship between the vector \\( b \\), the matrix \\( A \\), the vector \\( A \\hat{x} \\), and the column space \\( Col(A) \\). It should clarify how the least-squares solution \\( \\hat{x} \\) minimizes the distance between \\( b \\) and the projections \\( A \\hat{x} \\) within the column space. \n\nThe visualization should include a diagram that showcases the vector \\( b \\), the orthogonal projection \\( b_{Col(A)} \\) onto \\( Col(A) \\), and the relationship between \\( b \\) and \\( A \\hat{x} \\), highlighting the concept of minimizing the distance defined by \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) = \\| b - A\\hat{x} \\| \\). It can incorporate arrows illustrating distance measurements and highlight the squared differences to emphasize the \"least squares\" terminology.\n\nThis visual will help learners grasp the geometric interpretation of the least-squares method, enhancing understanding of how the orthogonal projection relates to minimizing errors in approximation. The expected educational outcome is an intuitive comprehension of the least-squares solution and its significance in linear regression and data fitting.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will be able to articulate the idea of orthogonal projections in least-squares solutions, visualizing the relationship between original vectors and their projections onto the column space, thereby fostering deeper insights into the minimization of discrepancies in linear modeling.",
