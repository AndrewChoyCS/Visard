The column space we refer to as \\( Col(A) \\) consists of all vectors expressible in the form \\( A x \\).

    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between the least-squares solution \\( \\hat{x} \\), the distance minimization \\( dist(b, A \\hat{x}) \\), and the orthogonal projection of vector \\( b \\) onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of least-squares solutions, focusing on how the vector \\( \\hat{x} \\) minimizes the distance to \\( b \\) through the orthogonal projection onto the column space \\( Col(A) \\). The visualization should illustrate the vectors involved: \\( b \\), \\( A \\hat{x} \\), and the projection \\( b_{Col(A)} \\), clearly indicating the distances and the relationships between these elements. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the sequential relationship between finding \\( \\hat{x} \\), minimizing the distance, and achieving the closest representation of \\( b \\). An appropriate visualization style could be a combination of a diagram and a graphical depiction that plots these vectors in a vector space. Ensure that the graph highlights the right angles created by the projection and the error vector \\( b - A \\hat{x} \\). \n\nThis visual will aid learners in grasping not only the mechanics of least squares but also the underlying geometrical interpretation, thereby reinforcing their understanding of the orthogonal relationships and how they contribute to minimizing discrepancies. \n\n**Objective**: By engaging with this visualization, learners will achieve a deep understanding of how least-squares solutions work, recognize the significance of projections in linear algebra, and appreciate the geometric interpretation of minimizing distances in vector spaces.",
