    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\nThe principle that should be visualized is **the relationship between the vectors in the design matrix \\(X\\), the scalar observations \\(Y\\), and the estimated weight vector \\(\\hat{w}\\) that minimizes the squared prediction error in least squares regression**.\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the relationship between the design matrix \\(X\\), the observation vector \\(Y\\), and the estimated weight vector \\(\\hat{w}\\) in the context of least squares regression.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the design matrix \\(X\\) contains the input vectors and how these vectors span a d-dimensional subspace within the N-dimensional space of outcomes represented by \\(Y\\). The visualization should clarify the concept of residuals (the differences between the predicted values \\(X\\hat{w}\\) and actual observations \\(Y\\)) as orthogonal distances from the vector \\(Y\\) to the subspace formed by \\(X\\). \n\nUsing a **3D scatter plot combined with orthogonal projection lines**, the visualization would depict the vectors \\(X\\) in one color, the observation vector \\(Y\\) in another, and the corresponding projections onto the subspace, emphasizing the notion of closest approximation. Additional elements, such as arrows showing the residuals pointing from \\(Y\\) to the closest point on the subspace, could enhance understanding. \n\nThis visual will help students grasp the critical relationship between predictors and outcomes, focusing on how minimizing prediction error translates to optimizing distance in multidimensional space. \n\n### Educational Objective\nThe objective of this visualization is to achieve a deep understanding of how the least squares method finds the best-fitting linear relationship by projecting \\(Y\\) onto the relevant subspace defined by \\(X\\), allowing students to interpret the geometric meaning behind linear regression visually and conceptually.",
