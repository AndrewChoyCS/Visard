    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared prediction error in least squares regression.**\n\nThe visualization should clearly illustrate the relationships between the observed values (Y), the input vectors (X), and the estimated weight vector (w). A key aim is to depict how the residual errors (the differences between the actual values and predicted values) should remain orthogonal to the column vectors of the design matrix X. A flowchart or diagram could effectively represent this, showing the linear combinations of the input vectors that approximate the output values while visually highlighting the orthogonal nature of the residual errors. This visual approach will help learners grasp the significance of orthogonality in minimizing error and the overall functionality of least squares regression in pattern recognition.\n\n**Objective:** The expected educational outcome is to deepen understanding of how least squares regression functions, particularly the geometric interpretation of minimizing squared errors, thereby enhancing comprehension of regression analysis in predictive modeling. This understanding should promote better analytical skills when evaluating the accuracy of predictive models in real-world data analysis.",
