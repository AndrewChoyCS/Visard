    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared error in least squares regression.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between the observed data points (Y) and the predicted values derived from the weight vector (\\(\\hat{w}\\)) applied to the design matrix (X). This could be achieved through a multi-part infographic or diagram that visually illustrates how the vectors (\\(X\\)) span a subspace in the higher-dimensional space of \\(Y\\), and how the optimal weight vector is determined by projecting \\(Y\\) onto that subspace. \n\nThe visualization should represent the concept of residual error (the difference between the observed and predicted values) and show how that error becomes minimized when the residuals are orthogonal to the spanning vectors of \\(X\\). By highlighting these relationships, the learner will better grasp the geometric interpretation of least squares regression and how it functions by aligning predictions closely with actual observations. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of how least squares regression minimizes prediction error by visualizing the relationship between observed data, predicted values, and the geometric interpretation of orthogonality in error minimization.",
