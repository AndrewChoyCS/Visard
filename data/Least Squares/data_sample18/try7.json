    "data": "Consider a collection of N vectors, {~x1, ... , ~xN}, where each vector has a dimension of d, accompanied by a corresponding scalar observation {y1, ... , yN}. These pairings, denoted as (~xi, yi), involve a vector regarded as the input (or predictor) and a scalar that's the output (or dependent variable). Our aim is to estimate a linear function that effectively predicts y from ~x: specifically, we want to determine a weight vector ~w such that yi is approximately equal to ~w > ~xi. We seek the ~w that minimizes the squared prediction error, given by the equation: \n\nsquared error = \u03a3\u1d62 (yi \u2212 ~xi \u00b7 ~w)\u00b2 (1)\n\nTo facilitate finding the solution, we will represent this as a vector equation.

We will differentiate our aspect of design matrix X focusing on its d columns rather than bundling them row-wise.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared prediction error in Least Squares regression.** The visualization should depict the relationship between the input vectors \\( \\mathbf{x}_i \\), the weight vector \\( \\mathbf{w} \\), and the resultant predicted values, emphasizing the orthogonality of the residual errors to the spanning subspace defined by the input vectors. \n\nThe goal is to illustrate how the weights are adjusted to find the optimal fit for \\( Y \\) by minimizing the discrepancies \\( ||Y - X \\mathbf{w}||^2 \\). By showing the projected point of \\( Y \\) onto the subspace defined by the design matrix \\( X \\) and using clear labels and arrows to represent the orthogonal residuals, learners will visualize the underlying mathematical relationships.\n\nThis visualization could take the form of a 3D diagram or interactive infographics, where students can manipulate the weight vector and observe changes in error minimization. It should highlight cause-and-effect relationships, specifically how adjustments in \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) affect the residuals and the overall prediction accuracy. The expected educational outcome is a deeper understanding of how linear regression aligns with geometric interpretations in vector spaces, enhancing the learner's comprehension of regression principles in practical applications. \n\n**Objective:** Equip learners with the ability to explain the significance of orthogonality in least squares regression and how it informs the estimation of the weight vector \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) for effective predictions, thereby fostering an integrated understanding of prediction modeling in data analysis.",
