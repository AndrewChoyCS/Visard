    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of minimizing the squared error in least squares regression, particularly the relationship between the observed data vectors (Y), the design matrix (X), and the weight vector (~w) in estimating a linear function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of minimizing squared error in least squares regression. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the residual errors (the discrepancies between the observed values in Y and the estimated values using the weight vector ~w and the design matrix X) relate to the orthogonality principle\u2014that the residual should be orthogonal to the input vectors in X. \n\nThe visualization should include a diagram illustrating the multi-dimensional space consisting of the observed vector Y and the subspace spanned by the columns of the design matrix X. Additionally, represent the true residuals as vectors that extend from the points on the subspace to points in Y, highlighting their orthogonality with the components of X. \n\nUsing an infographic style, this visualization will help learners comprehend cause-effect relationships, where minimizing the squared errors leads to improved predictions, thereby reinforcing the concepts of orthogonality and linear approximation in regression analysis. An objective of this visualization is to deepen understanding of how the alignment of data, models, and residuals play a crucial role in effective linear regression.",
