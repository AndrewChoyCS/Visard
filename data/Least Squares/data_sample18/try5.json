    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared prediction error in the context of least squares regression.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how vector projections and orthogonality relate to finding the optimal weight vector \\(\\hat{w}\\) that minimizes the error between observed and predicted outputs. By illustrating the relationship between the observation vector \\(Y\\), the design matrix \\(X\\), and the optimal projection of \\(Y\\) onto the subspace spanned by \\(X\\), learners can more intuitively grasp the geometric interpretation of least squares regression.\n\nThe visualization should utilize a combination of a 2D or 3D plot that displays the vectors \\(Y\\), the span of the columns of \\(X\\), and the resultant projection of \\(Y\\) onto this span. Incorporating labeled arrows to show the residual vector (error) and highlighting its orthogonality to the columns of \\(X\\) will effectively demonstrate the core mathematical relationship. \n\nThis visual aids in understanding by breaking down the concepts of vector projections and orthogonality into digestible elements, emphasizing how they work together to achieve the least squares solution. The expected educational outcome is that students will develop a stronger intuition about the importance of orthogonality in minimizing errors, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's underlying principles in practical applications.",
