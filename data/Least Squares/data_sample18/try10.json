    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of minimizing squared prediction error in least squares regression.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate the relationship between the observed outputs (Y), the predictors (X), and the estimated weight vector (w) that minimizes the squared error. Specifically, the visual will depict how the vector Y can be represented as a combination of weighted linear combinations of the columns of the design matrix X, showing the orthogonal projection of Y onto the subspace spanned by X. By including elements such as a 3D plot of the data points, the linear approximation, and the perpendicular residuals, learners can more easily grasp how the least squares method functions to minimize prediction error.\n\nThe visualization will utilize a 3D scatter plot for the data points, with visually distinct projections of Y onto the subspace defined by X, supplemented by arrows to represent residual errors. This style will help learners understand the geometrical aspects of the regression process, promoting insights into the orthogonality condition (where residuals are perpendicular to the subspace of the predictors). This approach will facilitate a deep comprehension of the linear algebra underlying least squares regression, allowing learners to visualize and internalize how the algorithm operates to fit the model effectively.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners should be able to comprehend the relationship between the observed outcomes and predictors as well as articulate how minimizing squared errors aligns with geometric projections in the context of least squares regression.",
