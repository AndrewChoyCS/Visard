    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Convex Sets and their Relation to Convex Functions\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to convex functions through their epigraphs. The visualization should clearly illustrate a convex set, highlighting how any straight line connecting two points within it remains entirely within the set. Additionally, depict a graph of a convex function alongside its epigraph, ensuring that the area above the graph is shown to form a convex set. Use layered diagrams or infographics to clarify the relationships between the convex set, the graph of the function, and the epigraph. This visual should help learners understand that when the epigraph is a convex set, any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on the graph itself.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** The objective is for learners to deeply understand the characteristics of convex sets and how they relate to convex functions. By visualizing these concepts, learners should be able to identify convex properties in various mathematical contexts, recognize the significance of the epigraph, and apply this understanding to solve problems involving convexity. The visualization should enhance the learner\u2019s capability to analyze geometric relationships and their implications in functional analysis.",
