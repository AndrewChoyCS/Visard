    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The relationship between convex sets and convex functions, specifically, the way the epigraph of a function represents its convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions in relation to their epigraphs. The goal is to illustrate how a convex set is defined by the property that for any two points within the set, the straight line connecting them remains entirely within the set. Additionally, show how the epigraph of a convex function consists of points on or above its graph, emphasizing that if the function is convex, any line segment drawn above this graph will either touch or lie on it. The visualization should integrate diagrams that depict both the convex set and its epigraph, using color coding to differentiate between points within the set and those above the graph. This will enable learners to better grasp the relationships between the shapes and functions, providing a clearer understanding of why such properties characterize convexity.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of convex sets and convex functions by visually exploring their definitions and properties, comprehending the importance of the epigraph, and recognizing how these concepts are interconnected in mathematical analysis.",
