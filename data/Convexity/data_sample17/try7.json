    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between convex sets and their epigraphs, particularly how a function\u2019s convexity is demonstrated through its epigraph forming a convex set.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function. The goal is to illustrate how a convex function can be identified by the convexity of its epigraph, highlighting that any line segment drawn above the function's graph will either touch or lie on the graph itself. The intended concept is the geometric representation of convexity, aiming for educational outcomes that include a clear understanding of convex sets, epigraphs, and how they connect to the properties of functions. \n\nThis visualization should include multiple graphs: one depicting a convex set with two points connected by a line segment entirely within the set, and another showing a function's graph along with its epigraph. Use an infographic style to contrast convex and non-convex functions. By visually illustrating these relationships, learners can grasp the essential characteristics of convexity and function behavior more intuitively, enhancing their understanding through visual representation and comparison.\n\n**Objective**: Deepen students' understanding of the nature of convex functions by illustrating the geometric implications of their epigraphs, enabling them to clearly identify and differentiate between convex and non-convex functions through visual cues.",
