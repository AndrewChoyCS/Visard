    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A convex set is defined such that any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside that set, and a function is convex when its epigraph (the set of points above its graph) forms a convex set.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in sets and functions through an engaging and illustrative diagram. The visualization should display a standard convex shape (like a circle or ellipse) next to a non-convex shape (like a crescent) to clearly contrast the principle of convexity. Additionally, overlay a graph of a convex function with its epigraph, highlighting the area above the graph and illustrating how any line segment drawn within this area either intersects with or remains on the graph. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the definition of convex sets and functions, making the relationship between the shapes and the graph intuitive. By visualizing these relationships, learners can more easily internalize that a convex function has an epigraph forming a convex set, deepening their understanding of why line segments behave as described. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** \nLearners should be able to identify and distinguish between convex and non-convex sets, understand how the epigraph corresponds to the convexity of functions, and visualize the behavior of line segments related to these concepts. \n\nBy highlighting cause-effect relationships and comparing convex vs. non-convex forms, this visual aid will reinforce learners' comprehension and retention of the concept of convexity in mathematical contexts.",
