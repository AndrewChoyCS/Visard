    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The concept of convex sets and the property of convex functions, specifically how the epigraph of a convex function forms a convex set where any line segment above the graph will either touch or lie on the graph itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a convex function. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the notion that a convex function\u2019s epigraph forms a convex set, highlighting that any straight line segment connecting points above the graph either touches or lies on the graph itself. This visual will include a graph illustrating a convex function, its epigraph, and line segments connecting various points above it. \n\nUse a diagram style that emphasizes the convex shape, labeling the key components clearly, such as the function graph, the epigraph, and the relevant line segments. The visualization should deepen understanding by illustrating the relationships between these elements, showing cause-and-effect dynamics where the convexity of the set influences the positioning of line segments. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will understand how the property of convexity influences function graphs and their epigraphs, demonstrating this through visual representation, to solidify their grasp of convex sets in mathematical contexts and applications.",
