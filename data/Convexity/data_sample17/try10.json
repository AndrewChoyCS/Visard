    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Relationship between Convex Sets and Convex Functions Through Epigraphs**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and convex functions, specifically focusing on the concept of epigraphs. The goal is to illustrate how a convex set is formed when the epigraph of a function consists of all points located above and on the graph of that function. This visualization should clarify the critical idea that within a convex function, any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on the function's curve, thereby demonstrating that its epigraph is a convex set. \n\nConsider using a combination of a 2D graph and shaded regions to represent the epigraph, alongside line segments drawn across various points to show their relationship with the function. Implementing infographics that illustrate definitions, properties, and examples of convex sets will further enhance understanding. \n\nThis visual aims to make clear the connections between the geometric properties of convex sets and the algebraic properties of convex functions. By emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between these concepts, learners can develop a profound understanding of convexity and its implications in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will be able to clearly identify and explain the defining properties of convex sets and convex functions through the use of epigraphs, enabling them to apply these concepts in problem-solving contexts.",
