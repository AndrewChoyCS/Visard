    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: A function \\( f \\) is convex if its epigraph (the points on or above its graph) forms a convex set, indicating that any line segment drawn above the graph will touch or lie on the graph itself.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions through the relationship between a function's graph and its epigraph. The goal is to depict how a convex function is represented graphically, showing that any straight line connecting two points within the epigraph remains entirely above the graph. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the convexity of a function and the properties of its epigraph, using line segments to demonstrate that they either touch or lie along the graph. An appropriate style for this visualization could be a layered graph that integrates both the function and its epigraph, along with highlighted line segments to illustrate the definition of convexity.\n\nThis visual aids in understanding by providing a concrete representation of an abstract mathematical concept, making it easier for learners to visualize convex sets and their properties. \n\n**Educational Objective**: Students will develop a deep understanding of convex functions by analyzing the geometric representation of their epigraphs and the implications of convex sets, ultimately enhancing their ability to recognize and apply the concept of convexity in various mathematical contexts.",
