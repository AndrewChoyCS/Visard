    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function, illustrating how a function is convex if its epigraph forms a convex set.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relation to convex functions via the epigraph. The goal is to clearly depict that a convex set is defined by the property that any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely within the set itself. Additionally, demonstrate how the epigraph of a function (all points on or above its graph) illustrates whether a function is convex based on the convexity of this set. By using a series of labeled graphs and infographics, highlight the cause-effect relationships between the shapes of the sets and the mathematical properties of convex functions. \n\nTo provide clear comparisons, include two separate graphs: one showcasing a non-convex function with its epigraph outside the convex set definition, and another displaying a convex function with its epigraph fully enclosing the applicable area. This visualization will aid learners in seeing the underlying structures of convexity, allowing them to intuitively grasp the definition and significance of convex functions.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will understand the concept of convexity by visualizing the properties of convex sets and how they relate to the epigraph of a function, enabling them to clearly distinguish between convex and non-convex functions through visual representation.",
