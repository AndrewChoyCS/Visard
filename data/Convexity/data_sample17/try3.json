    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function, specifically how a function is classified as convex based on the properties of its epigraph.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relation to the epigraph of a function. The visualization should clearly illustrate that a convex set allows any straight line drawn between two points within the set to remain entirely within the set. Additionally, depict the epigraph of a function f, highlighting that it includes all points above the graph. The goal is to demonstrate that a function is convex if its epigraph forms a convex shape, implying that any line segment drawn above the graph either touches or lies directly on the function. \n\n**Visualization Styles:** An infographic or diagram would be most effective, featuring a 2D graph displaying both the function f and its epigraph. Lines connecting different points within the convex set should be shown, accompanied by annotations emphasizing their properties.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** This visualization will enhance learners' understanding of the definitions and properties of convex sets and functions, enabling them to identify and describe convex shapes quickly. By focusing on the relationships between the points, the function, and its epigraph, the learners will gain a deeper insight into the structural properties of convexity and how they are applied in mathematical contexts.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and analyze the characteristics of convex sets and functions, demonstrating a clear understanding of how convexity relates to the epigraph of a function and its implications for geometric properties.",
