    "data": "To simplify, think of convex sets as shapes where any straight line connecting two points within the set lies entirely inside the set itself. This definition depicts what a convex set is. Now, if we consider the graph of a function f, the epigraph consists of all points that are located on or above the graph of this function. A function f is identified as a convex function when its epigraph forms a convex set. Consequently, this implies that any line segment drawn above the graph will either touch or lie on this function graph.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function, and how a function is defined as convex based on the shape of its epigraph.\n\n---\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to convex functions through the epigraph of a function. The visualization should demonstrate how any straight line connecting two points within a convex set remains entirely within that set, and illustrate the concept of an epigraph by showing all points located on or above the graph of a function \\( f \\). The goal is to clarify the definition of convex functions as those whose epigraphs form convex sets, highlighting the intuitive understanding that line segments drawn above the graph will either touch or lie along the graph. \n\nThe visualization could be an infographic that combines graphical representations of convex sets, line segments, and the epigraph of a sample function \\( f \\). Incorporate color coding to differentiate between the convex set, epigraph, and function graph, while using arrows to demonstrate the relationships between these elements. This visual aid will enhance understanding by making abstract concepts concrete, facilitating a more intuitive grasp of the properties of convexity.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will achieve a deep understanding of convex sets and convex functions by visually connecting the concept of line segments within these sets and their epigraphs, thereby fostering critical thinking about geometric relationships in higher-dimensional mathematics.",
