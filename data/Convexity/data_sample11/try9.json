    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of the Separation Theorem and its key role in demonstrating the existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself.** The visualization should clearly illustrate a closed convex set \\( C \\) in a two-dimensional space alongside a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of it. It should depict the separating hyperplane represented by a nonzero functional \\( x^* \\), emphasizing how this hyperplane divides the space such that \\( x_0 \\) lies on one side while all points in \\( C \\) lie on the other side. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the convex set, the external point, and the separating hyperplane, revealing their spatial interactions. A diagrammatic style will be effective for this purpose, showcasing the convex set, the point, and the hyperplane in a visually distinct manner. Utilize colors and arrows to indicate the directional separation and distance, while adding concise labels and brief explanatory notes to ensure the concept is easily comprehensible.\n\n**Expected educational outcomes include:**\n- A deeper understanding of the geometric interpretation of the Separation Theorem and its implications in both finite and infinite dimensions.\n- The ability to visualize and explain the role of duality in convex analysis.\n- A solid grasp of how the separating hyperplane operates within the context of convex sets, enhancing learners' appreciation for related concepts in functional analysis.\n\n**Objective:** To enable learners to intuitively comprehend and visualize the relationship and dynamics between closed convex sets, external points, and the hyperplane that separates them, thereby establishing a foundational understanding of duality principles in convexity.",
