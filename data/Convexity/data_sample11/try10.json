    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Separation Theorem of Convex Sets**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem regarding closed convex sets. The visualization should depict a closed convex set \\( C \\) in a two-dimensional plane (R\u00b2) along with a point \\( x_0 \\) located outside of \\( C \\). Illustrate a hyperplane (or functional \\( x^* \\)) that separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\), clearly indicating the relationship between \\( x^* \\), \\( x_0 \\), and points in \\( C \\). Use labeled diagrams to show the mathematical notations involved, such as the inequalities derived from the theorem (\u27e8\\(x^*\\), \\(x_0\\)\u27e9 + \\( \\delta \\) \u2264 \u27e8\\(x^*\\), \\(x\\)\u27e9). This will aid learners in visualizing not just the geometric configuration but also the conceptual framework of separation in convex analysis.\n\n**Goal & Educational Outcomes:**\nThe specific concept to clarify is the geometric interpretation of the Separation Theorem, highlighting the cause-effect relationship where the existence of the hyperplane effectively divides \\( x_0 \\) from points in \\( C \\). The visual should help learners understand how the theorem applies in different dimensions while reinforcing the core principles of convexity. An appropriate visualization style could be a detailed infographic that emphasizes these relationships, guiding viewers through the geometric and algebraic implications of separation.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective should focus on empowering students to grasp the nuances of convexity and duality by providing a visual representation of separation principles, thereby deepening their understanding of how convex sets operate and interact within various dimensions.",
