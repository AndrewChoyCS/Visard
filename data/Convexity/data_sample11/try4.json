    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The existence of a hyperplane (or functional x*) that separates a point x0 from a closed convex set C.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the separation principle of the duality theorem, focusing on illustrating how a hyperplane (functional x*) effectively separates a point (x0) from a closed convex set (C). The goal is to depict both the geometric interpretation in two dimensions and the abstract concept applicable to infinite dimensions. Use a diagram that prominently features the closed convex set (C), the external point (x0), and the separating hyperplane, clearly labeled with arrows that indicate the direction of separation. This visual should also include annotations that detail the mathematical relationship \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for points x in the set C, emphasizing the strict inequality. \n\nBy utilizing contrasting colors to differentiate the set, the point, and the hyperplane, learners will gain insight into the relationships and hierarchy of concepts involved in separation. The visual should deepen understanding by clarifying how these elements interact, thus fostering an intuitive grasp of convexity and its implications in various dimensions.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will be able to conceptualize the separation theorem, articulating how a hyperplane can divide external points from closed convex sets, thereby enhancing their understanding of duality in convex analysis and its geometric interpretations.",
