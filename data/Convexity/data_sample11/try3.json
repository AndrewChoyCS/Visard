    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of hyperplane separation in the duality theorem, particularly illustrating how a hyperplane can separate a point \\( x_0 \\) from a closed convex set \\( C \\). The goal is to clarify the idea that for any point outside of the convex set, there exists a linear functional (represented by the hyperplane) that strictly divides the point from the set, thereby enhancing understanding of the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The expected educational outcomes include recognizing the significance of hyperplanes in the context of convexity and duality, as well as visualizing the mathematical relationships that underpin this concept.**\n\nThe visualization should employ a diagram illustrating a closed convex set (C) in a two-dimensional space (R\u00b2) alongside a designated point \\( x_0 \\) positioned outside of it. The hyperplane (representing functional \\( x^* \\)) should be depicted as a dashed line or a different color for clarity. Highlight the inequality condition \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) by annotating the diagram to emphasize the relationship between the point, set, and hyperplane. \n\nBy using this clear visual representation, learners can intuitively grasp the separation principle, understanding the role of hyperplanes in demarcating regions of space and the relationship between elements within convex analysis. This will deepen their insight into the geometrical and functional aspects of duality in convex sets. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Understand and articulate the concept of hyperplane separation within convex sets and its implications in the geometric interpretation of duality theorems, facilitating a foundational comprehension of advanced convex analysis principles.",
