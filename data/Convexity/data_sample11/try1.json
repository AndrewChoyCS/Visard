    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a separating hyperplane (or functional) that divides a point outside of a closed convex set from the set itself, as established by the Separation Theorem.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of the Separation Theorem in convex geometry. The goal is to illustrate how a hyperplane can separate an exterior point \\( x_0 \\) from a closed convex set \\( C \\), emphasizing the relationship between the hyperplane, the point, and the set. The intended visualization should depict the hyperplane, the point \\( x_0 \\), and various points within the convex set \\( C \\) to highlight their relationships clearly. An appropriate style for this visualization could be a diagram with labeled axes (in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\)), along with annotations showing the mathematical relationship represented by the functional \\( x^* \\). \n\nThis visual aid will deepen understanding by clearly portraying the spatial arrangement and role of the hyperplane, as well as demonstrating how the Separation Theorem maintains its validity across different dimensions. \n\n**Objective:** Through this visualization, learners will grasp the essential concept of separating points and convex sets, enhancing their understanding of convexity's principles and the geometric implications of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.",
