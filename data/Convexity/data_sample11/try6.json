    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem within the context of convex sets.** The goal of this visualization is to clearly depict how a hyperplane (or functional x*) can separate a point x0 that lies outside of a closed convex set C. By representing this scenario in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional spaces, the visual will emphasize the relationship between x0, the convex set C, and the hyperplane x*. \n\nThe visualization should include labeled diagrams illustrating the convex set, the external point, and the separating hyperplane, alongside a clear depiction of the mathematical relationship described by \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. An infographic style that combines visual diagrams with concise annotations can enhance comprehension by highlighting causal relationships and clarifying the concept of separation through visual representation. \n\n**Objective:** To enable students to comprehend the concept of duality in convex analysis by visualizing the separation of a point from a convex set, fostering a deeper understanding of how this principle applies universally across dimensions and its implications in broader mathematical contexts.",
