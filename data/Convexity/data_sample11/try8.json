    "goal": "**Core Principle for Visualization:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point \\(x_0\\) outside a closed convex set \\(C\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of separation between a point and a closed convex set through a hyperplane, as expressed in the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The goal of the visualization is to clarify how a nonzero functional can effectively and strictly divide a point \\(x_0\\) from a closed convex set \\(C\\) in Euclidean space, particularly emphasizing the relationship between \\(x_0\\), \\(C\\), and the separating hyperplane \\(x^*\\). \n\nThe visualization should be structured as a multi-layered diagram, where the closed convex set \\(C\\) is prominently displayed, along with the external point \\(x_0\\) and the hyperplane labeled \\(x^*\\) with arrows indicating the separation relationship. Additionally, annotated explanations should highlight the inequalities represented in the theorem, showcasing how the hyperplane's position guarantees that \\(\u27e8x^*, x_0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x^*, x\u27e9\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(C\\).\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** The expected outcomes include a deep and critical understanding of the concept of separation in convex analysis, enabling learners to intuitively grasp the geometric implications of the theorem and enabling them to apply this understanding in a broader context of functional analysis. The visual aids will enhance learners' abilities to recognize and articulate the cause-effect relationship between the elements presented\u2014specifically how the functional \\(x^*\\) acts as a boundary separating \\(x_0\\) from \\(C\\), fostering better comprehension of the theorem's applications in both finite and infinite dimensions.",
