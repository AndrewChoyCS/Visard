    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The existence of a separating hyperplane (or functional) that distinguishes a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself.\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of a separating hyperplane as articulated in the duality theorem. The goal of this visualization is to clearly depict how a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside of \\( C \\) are separated by a hyperplane (or functional \\( x^* \\)). The specific concept to clarify is the mathematical relationship between these elements and how the hyperplane serves to distinctly divide them. \n\nThis visualization should take the form of a labeled diagram that includes the closed convex set \\( C \\), the external point \\( x_0 \\), the separating hyperplane, and the vectors representing the functional \\( x^* \\). It should also visually illustrate the inequality relationship defined in Theorem 3.5. By highlighting these relationships, students can better understand how convex sets and hyperplanes interact in both finite and infinite dimensions. \n\n**Educational Outcomes Expected:**\n- Learners will grasp the geometric relevance of the separating hyperplane in relation to convex sets.\n- Students will develop an understanding of the implications of the geometric Hahn-Banach theorem in real-world applications.\n- The visualization will aid in solidifying the conceptual framework needed for comprehending duality in convex analysis.\n\n**Objective for Deep Understanding:**\nTo deepen and enhance students' comprehension of the separation theorem by visualizing the distinct geometric and algebraic relationships involved, thereby empowering them to apply this understanding in both theoretical and applied contexts around convexity.",
