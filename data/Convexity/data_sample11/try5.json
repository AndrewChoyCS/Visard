    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\n**The Separation Theorem:** For any closed convex set \\( C \\) and any point \\( x_0 \\) outside \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (functional \\( x^* \\)) that separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis.** The goal is to visually represent how a hyperplane serves as a separator between a point \\( x_0 \\) and a closed convex set \\( C \\). This visualization should clarify the relationship between the point, the convex set, and the separating hyperplane, emphasizing the geometric interpretation of the theorem. Utilizing a two-dimensional diagram, plot the closed convex set \\( C \\), the external point \\( x_0 \\), and illustrate the hyperplane defined by the functional \\( x^* \\) along with the mathematical relationship \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) for any \\( x \\) in \\( C \\). \n\nIncorporating labels and arrows to indicate relationships will deepen comprehension of how this separation occurs and highlight the implications of the theorem in both finite and infinite dimensions. The visualization could integrate best practices in instructional design by sequentially illustrating the concept: first showing the closed convex set, introducing the point \\( x_0 \\), and finally presenting the hyperplane, demonstrating cause-and-effect relationships in the separation process.\n\n### Educational Objective:\n**Students will gain a deep and nuanced understanding of the Separation Theorem by visualizing the relationships between a closed convex set, an external point, and the hyperplane that separates them, thus reinforcing their grasp of geometric duality and the implications of the Hahn-Banach theorem.**",
