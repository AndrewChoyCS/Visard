This foundational idea is commonly known as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has numerous variations; a few are presented below.

    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, as described by the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of separation between a point \\( x_0 \\) and a closed convex set \\( C \\) through a hyperplane defined by a functional \\( x^* \\). The visualization should illustrate how the hyperplane effectively divides the space, showing \\( x_0 \\) on one side and all points of \\( C \\) on the other. Use a 2D diagram to represent the closed convex set as a shaded region and the hyperplane as a dashed line that distinctly separates these two entities. The goal is to clarify the relationship between the point, the convex set, and the hyperplane, enhancing understanding of the concept of convexity and separation in both finite and infinite dimensions. \n\nThe visualization should focus on relationships\u2014specifically, how the hyperplane is positioned in relation to both the point and the convex set, and how it fulfills the conditions of the Separation Theorem. Utilizing clear labeling and color coding will aid in distinguishing these elements, and a comparative analysis could be included by showing examples of different configurations of the point and set. This will help learners visualize concepts in a manner that promotes deep and crucial understanding of convexity and the underlying properties of functionals in dual spaces.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to intuitively grasp the relationship between a closed convex set and an external point in the context of hyperplane separation, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem and its applications in various dimensional spaces.",
