    "data": "A fundamental duality principle is that for any closed convex set C and any point x0 that lies outside of C, there exists a hyperplane (or equivalently, a functional x\u2217 in the dual space X\u2217) that effectively separates x0 from the set C. While this might seem intuitive in two-dimensional space, the concept is equally valid in higher dimensions, including infinite dimensions. This foundational idea is commonly known as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has numerous variations; a few are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem) states: Let C \u2286 X be a closed convex set and let x0 belong to X but not to C. There exist a nonzero functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4, such that \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. Essentially, x\u2217 serves to (strictly) distinguish the point x0 from the set C.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The separation of a point outside a closed convex set by a hyperplane, illustrating the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem and its implications in various dimensional spaces.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of separating a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside a closed convex set \\( C \\) using a hyperplane represented by a functional \\( x^* \\). The goal is to visually demonstrate how this hyperplane distinctly separates \\( x_0 \\) from all points within \\( C \\) while incorporating the inequality that governs their relationship. The visualization should effectively clarify the relationships between the point, the set, and the hyperplane, emphasizing how the functional distinguishes the two, maintaining clarity across both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional representations. Suggested styles include diagrams or 3D models to illustrate the separation clearly, enhancing comprehension of the underlying geometric principles.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners should achieve a deep understanding of how hyperplanes can segment closed convex sets, grasp the relevance of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem in different dimensions, and identify the properties of functionals in dual spaces. This visual will aid in recognizing cause-effect relationships between the point, the hyperplane, and the convex set, fostering intuitive insight into convexity concepts and their applications in higher mathematics.",
