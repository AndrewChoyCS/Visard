    "data": "A fundamental duality principle is that for any closed convex set C and any point x0 that lies outside of C, there exists a hyperplane (or equivalently, a functional x\u2217 in the dual space X\u2217) that effectively separates x0 from the set C. While this might seem intuitive in two-dimensional space, the concept is equally valid in higher dimensions, including infinite dimensions. This foundational idea is commonly known as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has numerous variations; a few are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem) states: Let C \u2286 X be a closed convex set and let x0 belong to X but not to C. There exist a nonzero functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4, such that \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C.

    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a separating hyperplane (or functional) that distinguishes a point outside a closed convex set from that set, as explained by the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of the separating hyperplane as described in the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how a closed convex set \\( C \\) can be visually separated from an external point \\( x_0 \\) using a hyperplane defined by a functional \\( x^* \\). The key educational outcomes expected are (1) an intuitive understanding of how hyperplanes can separate data points in both two and higher dimensions, and (2) a clear representation of the mathematical relationships involved, such as the inequality involving \u03b4. \n\nThe visualization should focus on the relationships between the convex set, the external point, and the hyperplane, using a diagram style that includes labeled axes to denote dimensions, shaded areas to represent the convex set, and distinct lines or planes to illustrate the separating hyperplane. This visual representation should effectively highlight the cause-effect relationship of the separation, allowing learners to grasp the geometric interpretation and implications of the theorem intuitively.\n\n**Objective:** Develop a deep and crucial understanding of how separating hyperplanes operate within convex analysis, empowering learners to effectively apply these concepts to various dimensions and contexts in mathematical analysis and optimization.",
