    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, as highlighted in the separation theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the separation theorem in convex analysis. The goal is to visually demonstrate how a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\) can be separated by a hyperplane represented by a functional \\( x^* \\). The visualization should clarify the concept of separation in both two-dimensional and higher dimensional spaces, emphasizing the directional relationship between \\( x^* \\) and the point \\( x_0 \\) versus points in \\( C \\).\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a series of diagrams: one showing a 2D representation with a convex set, a point outside the set, and the separating hyperplane; followed by a similar representation in higher dimensions (perhaps abstractly represented). Using arrows or shading could depict the \"distinguishing\" effect of the hyperplane, while annotations explain the mathematical relationships denoted by the notation \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\).\n\nThis visual aims to enhance understanding by focusing on the relationships and geometrical implications of the theorem. It will help learners to grasp the idea of duality and separation in convex sets by providing a clear, intuitive image of how a hyperplane can create a \"boundary\" between a point and a closed set.\n\n**Educational Objective:** To enable students to critically analyze and understand the geometric and algebraic implications of the separation theorem in convex analysis, thereby fostering a deep comprehension of the fundamental principles of duality in mathematical spaces.",
