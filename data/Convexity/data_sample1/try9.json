    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition of convexity in a function, particularly how function values at a convex combination of two points relate to their individual function values, as represented geometrically.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to depict how, for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in a convex set, the value of the function \\( f \\) at any convex combination \\( \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y \\) must be less than or equal to the convex combination of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\). This can be illustrated through a graph showing the curve of the function and the line segment connecting the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\). The visualization should highlight the area above the graph where the line segment sits, emphasizing the concept of convexity. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a clear understanding of how the inequalities define a convex function and the ability to visually connect algebraic expressions with geometric representations. Using a diagram or infographic style allows for the direct comparison of the function values and their linear combinations, thereby reinforcing the cause-and-effect relationships inherent in the definition of convexity. \n\n**Objective:** Students will deepen their understanding of the convexity concept by visualizing how function values interact at various points, enabling them to describe and explain the implications of convexity both algebraically and geometrically.",
