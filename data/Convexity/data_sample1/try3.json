    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** A function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is convex if the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of \\( f \\) lies above the graph itself, particularly illustrated through the relationship between points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in its domain.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how, for two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the domain of a convex function \\( f \\), the line segment connecting the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) remains above the graph of \\( f \\). This visualization should clarify the mathematical definition of convexity and emphasize the relationship between the convex combination of points and their images under \\( f \\).\n\nThe visualization could take the form of an infographic that prominently displays the function graph, highlights the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), and clearly shows the line segment between them. You might also include a separate section to depict how this relationship holds true even when \\( \\lambda \\) is set to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). The key educational outcomes expected are that learners will understand the geometric interpretation of convexity, recognize the necessary conditions for a function to be convex, and appreciate the visual assurance that this property holds for any linear combination of points in the domain.\n\n**Objective:** To foster a deep understanding of the concept of convexity by visualizing the relationship between a function and the geometric interpretation of its properties, enabling learners to confidently identify and analyze convex functions in various contexts.",
