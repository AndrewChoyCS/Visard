    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The inequality condition for convex functions, particularly the visualization of the relationship between points on a convex function and the line segment connecting them.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically illustrating that for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within the domain of a convex function \\( f \\), the function value at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the convex combination of their function values, which geometrically means that the line segment connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) to \\( (y, f(y)) \\) sits above the graph of \\( f \\).\n\nThe visualization should clearly show the graph of a convex function along with selected points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), highlighting their corresponding function values \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\). Indicate the line segment between \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) and shade the area below the line segment, showing that it lies above the graph of \\( f \\). This could be implemented as a dynamic infographic where users can adjust \\( \\lambda \\) to see how different convex combinations affect the inequality.\n\nKey educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deep understanding of the geometric interpretation of convexity, the significance of the defined inequality, and how midpoints relate to convex functions. By reinforcing the visualization of relationships between points and their function values, learners will grasp the fundamental nature of convexity in a more intuitive and impactful manner. \n\n**Objective:** Ensure that learners can identify and articulate the defining characteristics of convex functions through visual analysis, recognizing how the graphical representation reinforces the algebraic properties outlined in the convexity definition.",
