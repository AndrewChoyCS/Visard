    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The geometric interpretation of convexity, specifically that the line segment connecting two points on a function's graph must lie above the function itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), the evaluation of any convex combination of these points \u2013 represented by the expression \\(f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y)\\) \u2013 must not exceed the convex combination of the function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). The visualization should highlight the geometric relationship by depicting the graph of \\(f\\), the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\), and the line segment connecting these points. A clear indication of how the line segment sits above the graph of \\(f\\) will enhance understanding.\n\nThis visual should be presented in a diagram style that incorporates both the function graph and the connecting line segment, supplemented with labeled axes and key points. By illustrating this relationship, learners will gain crucial insights into the fundamental properties of convex functions, reinforcing their understanding of mathematical concepts related to optimization and analysis. The objective is to ensure that learners can visualize and articulate how convexity impacts the behavior of functions, deepening their comprehension of convexity as a cornerstone concept in advanced mathematics.",
