    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The definition of a convex function and the geometric relationship that the line segment between any two points on the graph must lie above the graph itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions in relation to their geometric representation. The goal is to illustrate how, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the domain, the function\u2019s value at a convex combination of these points must not exceed the same convex combination of the function values at those points. The visualization should include a positive curve representing the function \\(f\\), points \\(A\\) at \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\(B\\) at \\((y, f(y))\\), and the line segment \\(AB\\) that connects these two points, clearly showing that this segment lies above the curve. \n\nThis can be effectively presented as a diagram or infographic that highlights the cause-effect relationship between the convex properties of the function and its graphical representation. Including a shaded area under the curve can further emphasize the difference between the function values and the line segment, aiding in visual comprehension. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of the characteristics of convex functions, visualizing how the definition translates graphically, thereby reinforcing their comprehension of mathematical concepts in a multi-dimensional way. This process will help students visualize relationships and deepen their insight into the properties of convexity in functions.",
