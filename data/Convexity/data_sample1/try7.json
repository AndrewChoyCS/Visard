    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The geometric interpretation of convexity, specifically the graphical representation that shows how a convex function's graph sits below the line segment connecting any two points on its graph.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should depict a convex function along with two arbitrary points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within its domain. It should show the line segment connecting the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), clearly indicating that this segment lies above the graph of \\( f \\). This will visually emphasize the definition of convexity where \\( f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \\leq \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) \\) holds true for any \\( \u03bb \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nIncorporating a diagram that includes examples of chosen points \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and their convex combinations (such as \\( \u03bb=1/2 \\)) will help learners better grasp how convex combinations function geometrically. Additionally, using colors or shading to distinguish the line segment and the graph of \\( f \\) will enhance clarity while allowing students to visualize the relationship between points and the function. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of the concept of convexity as not just an abstract definition but a tangible geometric property of functions. By focusing on the visual relationships and the condition that must be met for convexity, learners will enhance their ability to identify and analyze convex functions in various contexts.",
