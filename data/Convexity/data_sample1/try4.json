    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle for Visualization:** The concept of convexity as defined by the relationship between two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a convex domain, specifically focusing on the idea that the function value at any convex combination of these points is less than or equal to the same combination of their function values.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should illustrate the geometric interpretation of convexity by showing the line segment connecting the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) along with several convex combinations between these two points using varying values of \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g., \\(\\lambda = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\\)). The goal is to clarify that the entirety of the line segment lies above the graph of the function \\(f\\), thus demonstrating the condition for convexity. \n\nThe visualization can be styled as a multi-panel diagram where each panel represents a different value of \\(\\lambda\\), clearly marking \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and the corresponding points \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). The segments and function graph should be labeled with both the values of \\(\\lambda\\) and their corresponding function values. This approach will help learners visually grasp the cause-effect relationship underlying convexity, reinforcing their understanding of the relationship between the points and the function's behavior in a clear and intuitive manner.\n\n**Educational Objective:** The objective is for learners to develop a profound understanding of convexity in functions by visually recognizing the relationship between points in the domain and the implications for the function's graph, thereby enhancing their ability to identify and verify convex functions in various contexts.",
