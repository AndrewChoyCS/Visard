    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted**: The convexity of a function is characterized by the fact that the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph itself.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how the line segment between two points on the graph of a convex function remains above the graph itself. This is intended to clarify the mathematical and geometric nature of convexity, emphasizing the relationship that for all convex combinations of two points, the function's evaluation is not greater than the linear combination of its values at those points. \n\nThe visualization should include a graph showcasing the function, points x and y, and the corresponding line segment. Additionally, integrate shaded regions to highlight areas under the function and above the line segment. This infographic-style visualization will aid in understanding by visually emphasizing the convexity condition and reinforcing the concept through direct comparison, making it easier for learners to grasp the underlying mathematical principles.\n\n**Educational Objective**: Learners will be able to visually identify and understand the properties of convex functions, enabling them to apply this knowledge to analyze and compare different mathematical relationships and functions effectively.",
