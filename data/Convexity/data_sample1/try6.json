    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all x, y in its domain, and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], we have f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).\u2022 In words, this means that if we take any two points x, y, then f evaluated at any convex combination of these two points should be no larger than the same convex combination of f(x) and f(y). Geometrically, the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) must sit above the graph of f. If f is continuous, then to ensure convexity it is enough to check the definition with \u03bb = 1/2 (or any other fixed \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)). This is similar to the notion of midpoint convex sets that we saw earlier. We say that f is concave if \u2212f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The geometric interpretation of convex functions, specifically that the line segment connecting two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph itself, embodying the essence of convexity.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the geometric interpretation of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), the value of the function at any convex combination of these points is less than or equal to the convex combination of the function values at those points. This concept should be clarified through a diagram showing the function graph, points \\(A (x, f(x))\\) and \\(B (y, f(y))\\), and the line segment connecting them, along with an area that represents convex combinations. \n\nThe visualization should include labeled axes, annotations that highlight key relationships, and clearly marked points to illustrate the definitions and ensure that learners can see the cause-effect relationship inherent in the definition of convexity. A combination of graphs and geometric shapes (like lines and shaded areas) will help to deepen understanding by visually connecting the mathematical definition to its geometric interpretation.\n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a thorough understanding of the concept of convexity in functions, recognizing that a graphical representation helps illustrate the relationships between points, function values, and the geometric properties that define convex functions. This understanding is crucial for applying the concept in optimization and economic contexts, where convexity plays a foundational role.",
