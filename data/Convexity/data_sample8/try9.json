    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions.** The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate how, for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within a convex function's domain, the weighted average of their function values (characterized by \\( \u03bb \\) in the range [0, 1]) must always lie below or on the curve itself. This should include depicting the curve of the function alongside a line segment connecting the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\).\n\nThe visualization will use a graph to display the convex function, highlighting the relationship between the function values and the corresponding linear interpolation for various values of \\( \u03bb \\). Specifically, the graph should include annotations and labels showing the points \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( f(x) \\), and \\( f(y) \\) alongside the segment \\( \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y \\) at key intervals (e.g., \\( \u03bb = 0, 0.5, 1 \\)). \n\nBy illustrating the required relationship visually, learners can better grasp how convex functions operate and reinforce their understanding of the underlying math principles, including why the line segment remains above the curve. The expected educational outcome is a deeper grasp of the convexity concept and the ability to identify convex functions in practice. \n\n**Objective:** Enable learners to illustrate and interpret the properties of convex functions, thus fostering critical thinking about mathematical functions and enhancing their ability to analyze convexity in various contexts.",
