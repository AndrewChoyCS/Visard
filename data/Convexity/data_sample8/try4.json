    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions.** The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate the relationship between points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), along with the function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\), and the line segment connecting these points, particularly focusing on how the curve \\(f\\) behaves in relation to this line segment. \n\nThe visualization should depict a 2D graph where the function \\(f(x)\\) is plotted against its inputs, clearly showing the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\). Include the line segment connecting these points, highlighting how it should remain above the curve of \\(f\\) for the function to be classified as convex. Visual elements can include shaded areas to represent the convex set and arrows indicating the range of \\(\\lambda\\) values.\n\nThis visualization aims to deepen understanding of how mixtures of points relate to function values in a convex context, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship between points in the domain and their functional outputs. By illustrating these relationships directly, learners will gain a more intuitive grasp of convexity, making it easier to later understand concepts such as concavity and the implications for optimization. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of convexity by visually demonstrating the critical relationship between function values at mixed inputs and their associated line segments, allowing learners to conceptually anchor this principle in real-world applications of convex functions.",
