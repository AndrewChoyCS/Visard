    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The visualization should convey the concept of convexity in functions by illustrating the relationship between points on a function curve and the corresponding line segment.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, highlighting how the function value at any mixture of two points (x and y) does not exceed the combined functional weights corresponding to f(x) and f(y). The goal is to clarify how the line segment connecting points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) always lies above the curve of the function f. Include graphical representations of at least two points on the curve, the line segment, and the function\u2019s curve, specifically displaying the midpoint (where \u03bb = 1/2). \n\nUse a combination of diagrams and graphs to illustrate the relationships between these elements, ensuring that learners can visually grasp the idea of convexity and understand the conditions under which a function is considered convex. This will aid students in recognizing convexity's geometric implications in real-world applications. \n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners will have a deep understanding of convex functions, able to identify convexity by visualizing the relationship between points and function values, and apply this knowledge in various mathematical contexts.",
