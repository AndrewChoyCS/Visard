    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between convex functions and the geometric positioning of their values, specifically how the function values at a convex combination of two points must not exceed the line segment connecting those points.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the domain of a convex function, the function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\) can be connected by a line segment that must lie above the curve of the function when assessing \\(f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y)\\) for \\(\u03bb \\in [0, 1]\\). This diagram should clearly compare the values of \\(f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y)\\) at specific midpoints (e.g., when \\(\u03bb = 1/2\\)) with the combined functional weights \\(\u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y)\\). \n\nThe visual representation could take the form of a multi-layered diagram that demonstrates the function curve, the selected points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and the connecting line segment, with labeled annotations to clarify the relationships and constraints inherent in convexity. Incorporating color coding for the function curve, the line segment, and the area above the curve will enhance understanding by highlighting key elements that depict the core principle. \n\nBy visualizing these relationships, learners will gain a deeper insight into the definition of convexity and the implications of these geometric interpretations, facilitating a crucial understanding of how convex functions behave within their domains. \n\n**Objective:** \nDeepen the understanding of convex functions by visually demonstrating how the geometric properties of function values at mixed points illustrate the definition of convexity, reinforcing the foundational concepts in convex analysis.",
