    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between function values at convex combinations of points in the domain and the geometric interpretation of convex functions.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions, particularly the relationship between points in the domain and their respective function values. The goal is to visually depict how for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within the convex set, the function value at any point along the line segment connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) does not exceed the weighted functional values \\( \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f(y) \\). This illustration should include a graph showing both the function curve and the line segment, with clear labels indicating key points and areas of interest.\n\nThe visualization should employ a graph style with overlapping elements\u2014such as shaded areas to indicate where the line segment lies above the curve\u2014and may include a diagrammatic representation of convex combinations with \\( \\lambda \\) values (e.g., setting \\( \\lambda = 0.5 \\) to demonstrate midpoint convexity). \n\nThis approach will aid in understanding the core principles of convex functions by highlighting the cause-effect relationship between the geometric representation of points and the functional values, thereby deepening learners' insight into how convexity is defined and verified in mathematical terms. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of convexity and its geometric implications, students should be able to identify and demonstrate how the function values at convex combinations adhere to the defining properties of convex functions, fostering a strong grasp of the visual and theoretical aspects of convexity in mathematics.",
