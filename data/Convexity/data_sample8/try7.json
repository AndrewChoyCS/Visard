    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Explain with Visualization:**\nThe relationship between points on a convex function and the linear combination of these points, specifically illustrating how the function value at any mixture of two points does not exceed the combined functional weights at those two points.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The goal is to illustrate how for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), the condition \\(f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1-\\lambda)f(y)\\) holds true. This visualization should clearly show the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) along with the line segment connecting them, emphasizing that this segment lies above the curve of \\(f\\). \n\nThe visualization could take the form of an infographic or diagram that includes both a plot of the convex function and clearly annotated points representing \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and their linear combination. Highlight the specific case where \\(\\lambda = 1/2\\) to demonstrate midpoint convexity. By visually representing the mathematical relationships and inequalities, the learner will gain a deeper understanding of how the definition of convexity is derived from the geometry of the graph. \n\n**Educational Outcome:**\nBy the end of the visualization, learners should be able to recognize and articulate the geometric interpretation of convex functions, understand the significance of the inequality that defines convexity, and apply this understanding to verify whether a given function is convex based on its graphical representation.",
