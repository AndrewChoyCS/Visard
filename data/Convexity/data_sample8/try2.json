    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The relationship between a function's values at different points and how this relationship reflects the concept of convexity, particularly through the comparative analysis of points on the function's graph versus the line segment connecting them.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions by illustrating the relationship between the function values at specific points and the condition that the line segment connecting these points lies above the function curve. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the mathematical definition of convexity using clear examples of points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), corresponding function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\), and the mixture point represented by \\(\u03bb\\) in the interval [0, 1]. \n\nThe visualization should include two graphs: one depicting a convex function with highlighted points and the line segment between them, and another graph that emphasizes how the values at the mixture point \\(f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y)\\) relate to the combined functional weights \\(\u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y)\\). Using diagrammatic representations and color coding for clarity will deepen the learner's insight into how convex functions maintain this particular relationship.\n\nThe educational objective is for learners to be able to identify and differentiate between convex and non-convex functions through visual analysis. This will enhance their understanding of how function behavior can be graphically represented, reinforcing the idea that the line segment between any two points on a convex function will always lie above the curve, thereby solidifying the definition of convexity.",
