    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The graphical representation of a convex function, emphasizing that the line segment between any two points on the function must lie above the curve itself.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly illustrating the relationship between two points on the curve and the corresponding line segment connecting them. The visualization should showcase the curve of the function \\( f(x) \\) while plotting points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) along with the line segment between \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\). It\u2019s important to highlight the area above the line segment to reinforce that the value of the function at any weighted average \\( f(\\lambda x + (1-\u03bb)y) \\) falls below or on the line. \n\nThe visualization will help clarify how convexity is defined graphically and the significance of the condition that the line segment stays above the function curve. This deeper understanding aims to enhance learners' insights into the properties of convex functions, specifically the cause-effect relationship between points on the curve and their linear combinations. Use a clear diagram style with labeled axes, curves, points, and segments to facilitate intuitive understanding. \n\n**Learning Objective:** To develop a profound understanding of the characteristics of convex functions and their graphical implications, enabling learners to identify and verify convexity through visual means and apply their comprehension to analyze functions in various mathematical and real-world contexts.",
