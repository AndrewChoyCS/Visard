    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions.** The goal is to illustrate how, for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the domain, and any \\( \\lambda \\) in the range [0, 1], the function value at the weighted average \\( f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y) \\) does not exceed the weighted combination \\( \\lambda f(x) + (1-\\lambda) f(y) \\). This visualization should clarify the relationship between the points on the curve and the line segment connecting them, emphasizing that this segment always lies above the curve for convex functions.\n\nThe visualization could be structured as a diagram displaying a convex function with clearly labeled axes. Include two points on the curve representing \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), with a bold line segment connecting these two points. Additionally, depict the point \\( f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y) \\) and highlight the area above the curve, illustrating that the line segment is above the function. An infographic style can be used to make it visually appealing and engaging.\n\nBy focusing on this clear visual representation, learners will develop an essential understanding of how convexity is verified and can visually grasp cause-effect relationships between weighted combinations of points and their corresponding function values. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and explain the conditions under which a function is considered convex by analyzing graphical representations, strengthening their understanding of the properties of convex functions in real-world applications.",
