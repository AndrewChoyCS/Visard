    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is considered convex if its domain forms a convex set. For any points x and y drawn from the domain, and for any \u03bb in the range [0, 1], it holds that f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) is less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that the function value at a mixture of the points x and y (characterized by \u03bb) should not exceed the combined functional weights that correspond to f(x) and f(y). Visually, this implies that the line segment connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve of f. If the function is continuous, it's sufficient for convexity verification to rely on the case where \u03bb is set to 1/2 (or another specific value between 0 and 1). This concept is quite similar to the midpoint convex properties covered earlier. A function is termed concave if its negative counterpart is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The definition of convexity in functions, specifically how the function values at a linear combination of two points do not exceed a weighted combination of their function values, and the visual implication of the line segment lying above the curve.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should depict the relationship between two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the domain and the implications of different values of \\(\\lambda\\) on the function \\(f\\). The goal is to illustrate that the function value at any point on the line segment connecting \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) must always be less than or equal to the value of the weighted function, emphasizing that the curve of \\(f\\) lies below this line segment. \n\nTo enhance understanding, use a combination of a graph plotting both the function \\(f\\) and the line segments for various \\(\\lambda\\) values, along with annotations that indicate the positions of \\(f(x)\\), \\(f(y)\\), and key points along the line segment. This visualization can take the form of an infographic or a labeled diagram that effectively highlights cause-effect relationships\u2014specifically, how selecting different \\(\\lambda\\) values impacts the positioning of the curve relative to the line segment. \n\nThe key educational outcome is for learners to grasp the geometric interpretation of convexity, enhancing their conceptual understanding of how and why convex functions behave in this manner, paving the way for deeper insights into optimization and analysis in convex settings.",
