    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The property of convex functions, specifically that their values at midpoints do not exceed the average of their endpoint values, and the connection with the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions, focusing on the relationship between the values of a convex function at the endpoints of an interval and the value at its midpoint. The goal is to visually demonstrate that for any interval within the function's domain, the function's value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean of its endpoint values. This visualization should include a labeled graph that plots a convex function, highlighting the endpoints and midpoint, along with a comparative visual element showing the arithmetic mean. \n\nAdditionally, integrate a separate section that illustrates the second derivative condition: visually representing positive second derivatives on the same graph to reinforce that when \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in the interval, the function is convex. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected include deepening students' understanding of how convexity manifests in the geometric interpretation of functions as well as reinforcing the analytical criteria involving second derivatives. This visualization can be structured as a diagrams-and-graph combination, which effectively clarifies the cause-and-effect relationship between the properties of the function and its curvature, offering a clear insight into the concept of convexity. \n\n**Objective:** To foster a comprehensive understanding of convex functions by clearly illustrating the relationship between midpoint values and endpoint averages, along with the implications of the second derivative condition, thereby providing students with visual and analytical tools to recognize and apply the concept of convexity in various mathematical contexts.",
