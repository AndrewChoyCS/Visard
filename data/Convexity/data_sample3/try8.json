    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The definition and characteristics of a convex function, specifically emphasizing how the second derivative relates to convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions, focusing on the relationship between the function's values at points and its midpoint in relation to the arithmetic mean. The visualization should illustrate a convex function graphically, highlighting the condition that the function's value at any midpoint does not exceed the average of its endpoints. Additionally, incorporate a section that visually represents the second derivative and its role in determining convexity by showing how \\(f''(x) \\geq 0\\) corresponds to a curve that is \"bending upwards.\" \n\nThe visual should use a multi-part diagram that combines a function graph, shaded areas illustrating the arithmetic mean comparisons, and annotated curves depicting the second derivative. This approach will help learners grasp the cause-effect relationship between midpoints, averages, and second derivatives, while clearly distinguishing convex behavior from non-convex behavior. \n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners grasp the foundational concept of convexity by visually connecting the properties of a convex function and its second derivative, enabling them to intuitively understand how these aspects influence the function's shape and geometry in mathematical analysis.",
