    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted**: The relationship between the convexity of a function and the behavior of its second derivative, specifically illustrating that a function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative over the interval.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions by illustrating the relationship between a function's graphical representation and its second derivative. The goal is to depict how, at every midpoint of an interval, the function's value does not exceed the average of its endpoints, thereby reinforcing the definition of convexity. This visualization should include graphs that show a convex function alongside values of its second derivative, clearly highlighting regions where \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\). Use a layered diagram style that sequentially presents the function, its corresponding second derivative, and the arithmetic mean comparison at key points to enhance understanding of the cause-and-effect relationships involved. \n\nBy visualizing these elements, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how convexity is determined, fostering better comprehension of the checks for convex functions using the second derivative test. The objective is to ensure students can identify and articulate the conditions necessary for a function to be convex and understand the implications of these mathematical properties in their graphical forms.",
