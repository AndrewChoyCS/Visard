    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between the properties of a convex function, specifically how its values at the midpoint of an interval relate to the values at the endpoints, and the implications of its second derivative being non-negative.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the properties of convex functions, focusing on the relation between the values at the midpoint of an interval and the endpoints. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how a convex function maintains a specific behavior at the midpoint relative to the endpoints, emphasizing the mathematical condition that the second derivative must be non-negative. The expected educational outcomes include a deeper understanding of the definition of convexity, recognition of convex functions through graphical representation, and the ability to identify conditions laid out by the second derivative.\n\nThe visualization should include a series of graphs depicting a convex function alongside several arrows and markers indicating the values at the endpoints and midpoint. An infographic style would be beneficial to clearly showcase the relationships between the values and to integrate the mathematical condition regarding the second derivative. This layered approach will enable learners to visually process the cause-and-effect relationship that defines convexity, alongside the verification of convexity through calculus concepts, thereby enhancing their comprehension of this foundational principle in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Objective**: Students will achieve a nuanced understanding of how the properties of a convex function manifest in graphical formats, connecting these properties to both the definition of convexity and its implications in mathematical analysis.",
