    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be convex is that its second derivative is non-negative over a specified interval.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically illustrating the relationship between a function and its second derivative. The goal is to depict how a convex function behaves in terms of its values at different points, specifically at the midpoint of intervals compared to the arithmetic mean of its endpoints. This visualization should clarify that if the second derivative of a function is non-negative throughout an interval, the function exhibits convexity. \n\nThe visualization can be structured as an infographic that combines a graphical plot of a convex function with labeled segments showing the interval endpoints, the midpoint, and the means. Include an overlay of the second derivative that is clearly marked to indicate when it is greater than or equal to zero. By highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship\u2014showing how the properties of the second derivative influence the shape of the function\u2014the visualization will deepen learners' understanding of convexity and how to determine it analytically and visually.\n\n**Objective**: The objective is to develop a thorough understanding of how the second derivative serves as a decisive criterion for convexity and to enhance students' ability to visually interpret and analyze the characteristics of convex functions in relation to their graphical representations.",
