    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition of a convex function and its relationship to the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of a convex function by illustrating how the value at the midpoint of an interval compares to the arithmetic mean of the function\u2019s values at the endpoints. This visualization should include both graphical representations of convex functions and a side-by-side comparison of their second derivatives, clearly demonstrating the criterion \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\). The goal is to emphasize the relationship between convexity and the behavior of the second derivative, enhancing the learner\u2019s understanding of the geometric interpretation of convex functions.\n\nThe visualization should take the form of a dual graphic: one featuring multiple convex function curves where midpoints are plotted along with their corresponding mean values, and another graph displaying the second derivatives of those functions. This dual approach helps articulate the cause-effect relationship between the shape of the function and the sign of its second derivative. By analyzing these relationships visually, learners will achieve a deeper insight into the mathematical properties of convex functions and the significance of the second derivative.\n\n**Objective:** To develop a solid understanding of the properties of convex functions, enabling students to visually and conceptually grasp how the parameters influence the function\u2019s curvature and the implications of the second derivative in determining convexity.",
