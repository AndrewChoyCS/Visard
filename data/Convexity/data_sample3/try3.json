    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The condition for a function to be convex, specifically that its value at the midpoint of any interval is not greater than the average of its values at the endpoints, and its second derivative is non-negative over that interval.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on the property that a convex function's midpoint value is less than or equal to the average of its endpoints. The visualization should include a graph of a convex function illustrating several intervals, with clear markers indicating the function's values at the endpoints and midpoint. An additional graph should depict the second derivative, highlighting that it remains non-negative across the interval. This dual representation will help learners clearly see the relationship between the geometric property of convexity and the mathematical condition of the second derivative. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected include an enhanced understanding of how convexity can be visually represented and a clearer connection between the geometric shape of the graph and the analytical condition of the second derivative being non-negative. Incorporating color-coded elements and annotations will guide learners through the relationships within the concept, making complex ideas more digestible and engaging. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep and crucial understanding of convex functions by visually demonstrating how convexity is reflected in both the graph of the function and its second derivative, thereby reinforcing the relationship between graphical representation and mathematical definitions.",
