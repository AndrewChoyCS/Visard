    "data": "A convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.If f(x) has a second derivative in [a,b], then a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be convex on that interval is that the second derivative f^('')(x)>=0 for all x in [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:**\nThe relationship between a convex function and its second derivative, specifically highlighting that for a function to be convex, its second derivative must be non-negative throughout the given interval.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and the criteria for convexity based on the second derivative. The goal of this visualization is to demonstrate how a convex function's shape relates to the midpoint values of intervals and how the second derivative provides a necessary condition for convexity. The visualization should clearly depict the relationship between the function's graph, its midpoints, and the arithmetic mean, as well as incorporate a graph illustrating regions where the second derivative is greater than or equal to zero. \n\nUse a diagram to show comparative analysis between convex and non-convex functions, explicitly marking regions of convexity based on the second derivative's behavior. This will aid in illustrating the progression of concepts from function definition to the criterion for determining convexity, reinforcing the understanding that a non-negative second derivative indicates an \"upward-curving\" behavior of the function.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will be able to deeply understand and articulate the relationship between a function's graph, its midpoint evaluations, and the implications of its second derivative on convexity, allowing them to analyze and classify functions based on these characteristics.",
