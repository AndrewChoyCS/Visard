    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Separation Theorem in Convex Analysis**\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis, which asserts that for any closed convex subset \\( C \\) and any point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane defined by the functional \\( x^* \\) that strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the hyperplane differentiates the point \\( x_0 \\) from all points within the convex set \\( C \\), emphasizing the geometric interpretations of separation in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional spaces. The expected educational outcome is for learners to understand the relationship between functional representation and geometric separation, as well as how this theorem applies across different dimensions, reinforcing concepts of convexity.  \n\nThe visualization should include a series of diagrams, one depicting the two-dimensional case with clear labeling of the hyperplane, \\( x_0 \\), and points in \\( C \\). Additional contexts could be given as parallel visuals for higher-dimensional representations, showing how the same concepts apply in abstraction. Incorporating color contrasts and distinct shapes will help denote various regions in space and enhance cognitive clarity regarding this abstract principle. \n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding of the geometric implications of the Separation Theorem, enabling learners to visualize and articulate the concept of functional separation within closed convex subsets, thus solidifying their grasp of convexity theory in both practical and theoretical contexts.",
