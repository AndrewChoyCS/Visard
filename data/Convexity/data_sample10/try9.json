    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle**: The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, demonstrating the separation properties captured in the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in duality theory, particularly focusing on the geometric representation of a closed convex subset \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the hyperplane (or functional \\( x^* \\)) that separates them. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between these elements and illustrate how the functional \\( x^* \\) distinguishes \\( x_0 \\) from points within \\( C \\). \n\nThe visualization should employ a layered diagram that showcases the convex set \\( C \\) and the point \\( x_0 \\) in a two-dimensional space, with the hyperplane drawn to clearly illustrate how it segregates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). Arrows can indicate the direction of the functional\u2019s evaluation. \n\nBy presenting these elements together, the visual will highlight the core concept of separation in convex analysis, allowing learners to intuitively grasp the relationships between the closed set, the separating hyperplane, and the external point. Learning outcomes should include a deep understanding of the geometric implications of duality theory and the ability to visualize higher-dimensional separations effectively.\n\n**Objective**: Enable students to visually conceptualize and articulate the principles of separation in convex sets, enhancing their understanding of duality theory, and allowing for deeper comprehension of how the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem applies not just in two-dimensional cases but across higher-dimensional spaces.",
