    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The existence of a hyperplane (or functional x\u2217) that separates a point outside a closed convex subset from the subset itself, as described in the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of separation in duality theory as articulated in the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The goal is to illustrate how a hyperplane (functional x\u2217) can distinguish a point x0 from a closed convex subset C by visually representing both the subset and the hyperplane in a multi-dimensional space. This visualization should clarify the key relationships between x0, C, and the hyperplane, emphasizing how the functional x\u2217 effectively separates x0 from all points within C, thus highlighting the properties of convexity and duality.\n\nThe preferred style for this visualization is a detailed diagram that utilizes both two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements to represent the closed convex set and the hyperplane. Annotations and labels should clearly denote each component\u2014x0, C, and x\u2217\u2014to facilitate comprehension. Additionally, using color coding can help differentiate between the separated regions for better clarity.\n\n**Learning Objective:** By engaging with the visualization, learners will develop a profound understanding of how the separation theorem operates in both finite and infinite dimensions, reinforcing their grasp of convexity in duality theory and enhancing their ability to recognize and articulate the implications of these concepts in higher-dimensional contexts.",
