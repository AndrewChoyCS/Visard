While this might appear evident in two-dimensional space by sketching a diagram, it actually holds true in higher-dimensional spaces, including infinite dimensions. This principle is commonly referred to as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has several related variations; a few of these variations are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem). Let C be a closed convex subset of X, and let x0 be an element of X that is not in C. It follows that there exists a non-trivial functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4 where \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. In this way, x\u2217 effectively (strictly) separates x0 from C.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, demonstrating the geometric interpretation of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of hyperplane separation in the context of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. The goal is to visually represent how a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of it can be distinguished by a hyperplane (or functional \\( x^* \\)). This diagram should include two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations to illustrate that the principle applies in higher dimensions as well. The visualization could take the form of a series of diagrams that clearly label the convex set \\( C \\), the external point \\( x_0 \\), the separating hyperplane, and the relationships between these elements. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deeper understanding of the concept of separation, the nature of convex sets, and the application of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem in various dimensions. By illustrating the relationships and spatial dynamics, students will develop an intuitive grasp of how separation operates geometrically and conceptually, helping to clarify the significance of duality in convex analysis. This visual representation will highlight cause-and-effect relationships between the point, the set, and the hyperplane, thereby enhancing retention of the core principle.",
