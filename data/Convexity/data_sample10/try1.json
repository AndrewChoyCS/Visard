    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The ability of a hyperplane (functional) \\( x^* \\) to separate a point \\( x_0 \\) outside a closed convex set \\( C \\) is fundamental to understanding the separation theorem in duality theory.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in duality theory, which states that for any closed convex subset \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane \\( x^* \\) that separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the concept of separation in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional spaces, emphasizing how \\( x^* \\) distinguishes \\( x_0 \\) from all elements within \\( C \\). \n\nThe visualization should ideally utilize a combination of diagrams and multidimensional models to represent the relationships between \\( x^* \\), \\( x_0 \\), and the closed convex set \\( C \\), clearly showing the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( C \\). \n\nBy incorporating visual elements such as shaded areas or lines to represent the hyperplane and regions in the space, learners can develop a deep and clear understanding of how the separation exists and the geometric implications of this theorem. This will enhance their grasp of convexity and the foundations of duality theory in functional analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:** \nStudents will achieve a crucial understanding of the geometric implications of the Separation Theorem and how hyperplanes serve as vital tools for distinguishing elements in convex analysis, underpinning their applications in optimization and functional spaces.",
