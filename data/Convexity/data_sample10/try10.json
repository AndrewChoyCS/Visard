While this might appear evident in two-dimensional space by sketching a diagram, it actually holds true in higher-dimensional spaces, including infinite dimensions. This principle is commonly referred to as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has several related variations; a few of these variations are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem). Let C be a closed convex subset of X, and let x0 be an element of X that is not in C. It follows that there exists a non-trivial functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4 where \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. In this way, x\u2217 effectively (strictly) separates x0 from C.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Separation Theorem**\n\n**Query: Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem, illustrating the relationship between a closed convex set \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the separating hyperplane \\( x^* \\). The goal of this visualization is to clarify how \\( x^* \\) can effectively distinguish \\( x_0 \\) from all points within \\( C \\) using a geometric approach. This should include representations in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional contexts to emphasize that the principle holds universally, even in infinite dimensions. Appropriate styles for this visualization could include diagrams illustrating the separation in 2D and 3D, highlighting the geometrical relationship as well as comparative elements demonstrating the effect of the constant \\( \\delta \\). \n\nThe educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deeper understanding of the concept of duality, an appreciation of how hyperplanes can separate points in convex analysis, and insight into the implications of the Hahn-Banach theorem in various dimensions. This visual should focus on cause-effect relationships by showing how the positioning of \\( x_0 \\) relative to \\( C \\) leads to the identification of the functional \\( x^* \\), thereby supporting learners in grasping these mathematical ideas profoundly. By clearly delineating the roles of each element within the theorem, learners will be better equipped to apply this understanding to both theoretical and practical problems in convexity.",
