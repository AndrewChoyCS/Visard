    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The existence of a hyperplane that can distinguish a point outside a closed convex set from points within it, as described by the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the separation of a point \\( x_0 \\) from a closed convex set \\( C \\) using a hyperplane defined by a functional \\( x^* \\). The goal of this visual is to clarify how the hyperplane serves as a geometric boundary that effectively separates \\( x_0 \\) from all elements in \\( C \\). This visualization should depict the closed convex set in a multi-dimensional space, highlighting the position of the point outside the set, and draw the hyperplane with clear annotations showing the inequalities governing the separation. \n\nThe visualization should utilize a diagram style that allows for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional representation, showcasing the relationships between \\( x_0 \\), \\( C \\), and \\( x^* \\). Additionally, it should highlight the condition of separation with labeled arrows indicating where the functionals apply, reinforcing the learner\u2019s understanding of the mathematical inequalities involved. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a robust grasp of the concept of convexity and duality, the ability to visualize and understand separation in both finite and infinite dimensions, and an appreciation of how functional analysis is applied in these contexts. This objective focuses on deep understanding by allowing students to visually comprehend and engage with relational geometry, thus supporting better retention and application of mathematical concepts.",
