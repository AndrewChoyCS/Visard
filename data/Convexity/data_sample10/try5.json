While this might appear evident in two-dimensional space by sketching a diagram, it actually holds true in higher-dimensional spaces, including infinite dimensions. This principle is commonly referred to as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has several related variations; a few of these variations are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem). Let C be a closed convex subset of X, and let x0 be an element of X that is not in C. It follows that there exists a non-trivial functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4 where \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. In this way, x\u2217 effectively (strictly) separates x0 from C.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The Separation Theorem illustrates that a closed convex set \\( C \\) can be distinctly separated from a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of it by a hyperplane represented by a functional \\( x^* \\).\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem of duality theory, highlighting how a closed convex set \\( C \\) can be separated from a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of it by a hyperplane defined by the functional \\( x^* \\). The visualization should clearly depict this hyperplane and its role in distinguishing \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\) in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional contexts. The goal is to elucidate the relationship between \\( C \\), \\( x_0 \\), and \\( x^* \\), and to display how varying positions of \\( x_0 \\) influence the positioning of the hyperplane. Suggested styles include a series of diagrams illustrating different cases in various dimensions. By incorporating color coding and labels, the visualization will reinforce understanding of configurations and how hyperplanes can effectively separate points from convex sets. \n\n**Learning Objective:**\nLearners will be able to deeply understand the logical structure of duality in convex analysis, specifically how hyperplanes can be utilized to distinguish between points not contained in convex sets, enhancing their grasp of geometric interpretations in higher dimensions.",
