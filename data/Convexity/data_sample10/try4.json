    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside of a closed convex set from the set itself, as illustrated by the geometric Hahn-Banach theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of the Separation Theorem in duality theory, particularly focusing on how a hyperplane can distinguish a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of a closed convex set \\( C \\). The visualization should clearly illustrate the relationships between the set \\( C \\), the point \\( x_0 \\), and the separating hyperplane or functional \\( x^* \\), as well as the constraint involving the constant \\( \\delta \\). \n\nThe goal is to show how the hyperplane effectively separates \\( x_0 \\) from all points \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), emphasizing the nature of strict separation. A diagram or infographic style would be most effective, using clear geometric shapes to represent the convex set, the point outside it, and the hyperplane, with appropriate labeling to clarify each element's role. \n\nThis visual aid will deepen learners\u2019 understanding of the concept by allowing them to see not only the relationships between these elements but also the intuitive geometric interpretation of the theorem across different dimensions. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep and crucial understanding of how duality theory's Separation Theorem operates geometrically, allowing learners to grasp the importance of hyperplanes in distinguishing between sets and points in a convex space.",
