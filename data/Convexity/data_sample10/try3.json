While this might appear evident in two-dimensional space by sketching a diagram, it actually holds true in higher-dimensional spaces, including infinite dimensions. This principle is commonly referred to as the geometric Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which has several related variations; a few of these variations are presented below. Theorem 3.5 (The Separation Theorem). Let C be a closed convex subset of X, and let x0 be an element of X that is not in C. It follows that there exists a non-trivial functional x\u2217 \u2208 X\u2217 and a positive constant \u03b4 where \u27e8x\u2217, x0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x\u2217, x\u27e9 for all x in C. In this way, x\u2217 effectively (strictly) separates x0 from C.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The existence of a hyperplane (or functional) that strictly separates a point outside a closed convex set from that set itself.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of hyperplanes as separators of closed convex sets in duality theory. This visualization should illustrate the relationship between a closed convex subset \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the hyperplane \\( x^* \\) that effectively separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). The visualization should include a 2D diagram showing \\( C \\) and \\( x_0 \\) along with the hyperplane, using clearly labeled axes and annotations to denote the mathematical relationships, such as the inequalities described in Theorem 3.5. \n\nThe goal is to clarify how the hyperplane creates a boundary that maintains the separation, facilitating a deeper understanding of duality in higher-dimensional spaces. This visual representation will enhance learners' ability to comprehend how and why these separations are mathematically significant, promoting discussions on the implications of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem in various contexts.\n\n**Educational Objective:** \nStudents will gain a robust understanding of the geometric interpretation of duality theory, focusing on the role of hyperplanes in distinguishing points from convex sets, thereby grasping the foundational principles that underpin convexity and duality in functional analysis.",
