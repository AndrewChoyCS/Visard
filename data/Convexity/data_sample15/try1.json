    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the definition of a convex function and the condition of its second derivative being non-negative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the definition of a convex function and the significance of its second derivative being non-negative. The goal is to clearly illustrate how, for any interval within the function\u2019s domain, the function's value at the midpoint relates to the values at the endpoints, demonstrating the mathematical concept of convexity. Additionally, the visualization should highlight that a function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative across that interval, reinforcing the connection between the graphical representation and the analytical condition. \n\n**Visualization Styles:** An infographic that incorporates a graph of a convex function depicting the curve, a highlighted midpoint, and lines connecting the midpoint to the endpoints. Use color coding to differentiate between the function, the average value lines, and the region defined by the condition of the second derivative.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** This visualization should aid learners in recognizing the geometric interpretation of convex functions as well as understanding the critical relationship between the shape of the graph and the mathematical properties (i.e., the second derivative test). The visual will provide a clear cause-effect relationship between the convexity condition and the shape of the graph, thus deepening the understanding of both definitions and implications. \n\n**Objective:** Ensure that learners can identify and describe the characteristics of convex functions and articulate the role of the second derivative in determining convexity, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the concept in both visual and analytical contexts.",
