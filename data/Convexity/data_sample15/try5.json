    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:**\nThe relationship between the values of a convex function at intervals and its second derivative's non-negativity.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should depict a graph of a convex function along with its endpoints and the midpoint of an interval, clearly illustrating that the value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, include a second graph demonstrating the second derivative, highlighting that it remains non-negative across the interval [a, b]. This aims to clarify how the properties of convexity are interconnected through the function's shape and its curvature. \n\nThe visualization should be an infographic style that combines elements of both graphical representation and concise textual annotations to highlight cause-and-effect relationships. By distinctly showing how a convex function behaves and how its second derivative informs that behavior, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental characteristics of convexity.\n\n**Objective:**\nStudents will achieve a comprehensive understanding of convex functions by visually interpreting the relationship between the function's midpoints and endpoints, as well as grasping the significance of the second derivative in confirming convexity, thereby fostering critical analytical skills in function analysis.",
