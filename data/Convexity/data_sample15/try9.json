    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The relationship between the convexity of a function and its second derivative, specifically illustrating that for a function to be convex, the second derivative must be non-negative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly emphasizing the relationship between a convex function and its second derivative. The visualization should show how a continuous function's value at the midpoint of any interval is less than or equal to the average of its endpoint values, reinforcing the concept of convexity through graphical representation. Utilize a combination of plots\u2014one depicting a convex function with labeled midpoint and endpoint values, and another showcasing the second derivative, indicating its non-negativity across the interval. \n\nThis visualization aims to clarify the functional relationship in convexity, highlight cause-effect relationships between a function and its second derivative, and facilitate comparisons between convex and non-convex functions. By integrating line graphs and shaded areas to represent the midpoint condition visually, learners will more deeply understand how these mathematical properties interconnect.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of convex functions and the significance of the non-negativity of the second derivative, enabling them to recognize convexity in various mathematical contexts and apply this understanding to problem-solving involving convex functions.",
