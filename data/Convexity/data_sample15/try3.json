    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the midpoint of a convex function's values and the average of its endpoint values, along with the significance of the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how, for a convex function, the value at the midpoint of an interval is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints. The specific concept intended to be clarified is the graphical representation of a convex function alongside its second derivative, emphasizing the condition that the second derivative \\(f''(x)\\) must be non-negative within a specified interval. \n\nUtilize a combination of line graphs and shaded areas: depict a convex function curve, clearly label the points at the endpoints and the midpoint of an interval, and visually highlight that the value at the midpoint is below or equal to the average of the end values. Additionally, include a graph of the second derivative, showing that it remains non-negative across the interval. This dual visualization effectively demonstrates the relationships and interdependencies inherent to the concept of convexity, enhancing learners\u2019 understanding of its mathematical properties.\n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will achieve a deep understanding of how convexity is defined through midpoint values and second derivatives, thereby strengthening their ability to identify and analyze convex functions in various mathematical contexts.",
