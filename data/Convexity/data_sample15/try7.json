    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The relationship between the midpoint value of a convex function and the values at the endpoints, as well as the role of the second derivative in determining convexity.\n\n---\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship that defines a convex function, focusing on the condition where the value at the midpoint of an interval is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. The visualization should illustrate a graph of a convex function alongside marked points at the interval endpoints and the midpoint, clearly showing this relationship. Additionally, include a depiction of the second derivative f''(x) with a color gradient indicating its non-negativity throughout the interval [a,b]. This visual aims to clarify the core concepts of convexity, demonstrating how the specific geometric properties of the function correlate with the mathematical conditions for convexity. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a solid understanding of what constitutes a convex function, the significance of the second derivative, and the ability to visually interpret the relationship between midpoint and endpoint values. The use of a graph to highlight these relationships will facilitate deeper understanding by illustrating the cause-effect dynamic between changes in function shape and its mathematical properties, encouraging learners to visualize numerical relationships in geometric forms.\n\n**Objective:** To deepen learners' understanding of convex functions by visually demonstrating the relationship between midpoint and endpoint values and highlighting the role of the second derivative in determining convexity, thereby bridging mathematical theory with practical visualization techniques.",
