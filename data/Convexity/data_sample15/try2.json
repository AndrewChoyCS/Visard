    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:**\nThe definition of a convex function and the criterion for convexity based on the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and their properties, particularly focusing on the relationship between the function\u2019s values at the endpoints and its value at the midpoint of an interval. The goal is to visually demonstrate how, for any interval within a convex function's domain, the value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, illustrate the significance of the second derivative being non-negative, using graphs to show examples of various functions that are convex and non-convex. \n\nThis visualization should adopt a combination of line graphs to depict convex and non-convex functions, annotated with the relevant intervals and midpoints, as well as a highlighted section showing the second derivative and its implications on the shape of the curve. Integrating best practices, such as providing clear labels, using color coding to differentiate between convex and non-convex functions, and showing cause-effect relationships between the second derivative and the function's convexity, will aid in enhancing learner comprehension.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will achieve a deep understanding of the properties of convex functions, enabling them to identify convexity not only through definitions but through graphical representation and analysis.",
