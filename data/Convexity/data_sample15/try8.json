    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition of a convex function, emphasizing the midpoint property and the non-negativity of the second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the properties of a convex function, focusing on the midpoint criterion and the condition regarding the second derivative. The goal is to visually depict a graph illustrating a convex function alongside examples of intervals, where the function value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, illustrate the second derivative being non-negative on that interval, emphasizing how this guarantees the function\u2019s convexity. \n\nUtilize a combination of graphs and labeled diagrams to highlight these relationships and processes. The visualization should clearly differentiate between a convex function and non-convex functions, illustrating the importance of the midpoint property and the role of the second derivative. \n\nBy incorporating color-coding and annotations, the visual will guide learners in identifying the key characteristics of convexity. The expected educational outcome is to deepen the student\u2019s understanding of convex functions, elucidate the motivation behind convexity in calculus, and provide clear examples that reinforce their application. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually interpret and articulate the definition of convex functions and the implications of a non-negative second derivative, enhancing their comprehension of mathematical concepts related to convexity and its significance in optimization and analysis.",
