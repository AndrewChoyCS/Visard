    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The definition of a convex function and the role of its second derivative in determining convexity.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on how the value at the midpoint of an interval relates to the average of the endpoint values, alongside the significance of the second derivative being non-negative. The goal is to illustrate the essential property that characterizes convex functions and the necessary mathematical condition for convexity, thereby clearing up potential misconceptions about the nature of such functions. The visualization should utilize a combination of graphs showing convex functions, highlighting the relationship between midpoint values and endpoint averages, as well as a plot displaying the second derivative to indicate its behavior within an interval. \n\nThis visualization may include an infographic format that highlights cause-and-effect relationships and comparative analyses, enabling learners to see why these properties define convex functions visually. Specific outcomes should include a clear understanding that if the second derivative is non-negative, the function curves upward, supporting the midpoint property, fostering insight into how these mathematical conditions intertwine in the realm of convexity.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will demonstrate a deep understanding of the characteristics of convex functions and their mathematical underpinnings by interpreting visual data that depicts the relationship between midpoint values, endpoint values, and the behavior of the second derivative, ultimately gaining insights into the implications of these properties in real-world applications.",
