    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between convex functions and the behavior of their second derivatives, specifically that a convex function has a non-negative second derivative.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions, focusing specifically on the relationship between the values at the midpoint of an interval and the average of its endpoints, alongside the condition that the second derivative must be non-negative. This visualization should clearly depict a graph of a convex function, highlighting the interval with marked points at the endpoints and the midpoint. The midpoint value should be compared to the average of the endpoints, visually demonstrating the convexity property. Additionally, include a side panel illustrating the second derivative, showing how it remains non-negative across the interval.\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the mathematical definition of convexity and illustrate the importance of the second derivative in establishing this property. By using a dual graph style\u2014one showing the function and another showing its second derivative\u2014the viewer can easily grasp the relationship between function shape and its curvature. This approach will help learners understand the concept of convexity in depth, focusing on how changes in the second derivative relate to the function's convex nature.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to articulate the significance of convexity in functions by analyzing the relationship between the first and second derivatives, thereby reinforcing their understanding of functions in calculus and their applications in optimization.",
