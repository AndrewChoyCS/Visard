    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function for which the value at the midpoint of any interval in its domain is less than or equal to the average of its values at the endpoints of that interval. For a function f(x) that has a second derivative on the interval [a,b], the essential and necessary condition for it to exhibit convexity within that range is that the second derivative f''(x) must be non-negative for all x in the interval [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The requirement for a convex function is that the value at the midpoint of any interval is less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints, which is linked to the non-negativity of the second derivative within that interval.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and their characteristics, particularly focusing on the relationship between the values at the midpoint and the endpoints of an interval. The goal is to illustrate how the definition of convexity is rooted in the midpoint condition and how the second derivative being non-negative reflects this property. This visualization should use a combination of graphs illustrating various convex functions alongside labeled points to demonstrate the midpoint comparison against the average of endpoint values. The educational outcomes expected include a clear understanding of how convexity is defined, a visual demonstration of the relationship between the function\u2019s behavior and its second derivative, and a comparison that emphasizes the implications of these concepts in practical scenarios. Employing line graphs and annotated sections will help highlight cause-effect relationships and reinforce learners\u2019 insights into the nature of convex functions and their differentiability. \n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will develop a deep understanding of how the properties of convex functions are interconnected through the midpoint condition and the behavior of second derivatives, enabling them to apply these concepts in analyzing various mathematical functions and their implications in optimization problems.",
