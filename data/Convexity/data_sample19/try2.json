    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The visual representation of convex sets and their properties, specifically illustrating the relationship between a function's graph, its epigraph, and the concept of convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to the epigraph of a function. The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate that a convex function's graph contains all line segments connecting any two points on or above the graph, emphasizing that the epigraph consists solely of points that lie at or above this curve. This visual should include a graph of a convex function with its epigraph highlighted, overlaid with examples of line segments between various points, showcasing that these segments remain above the graph. By using a diagrammatic style combined with color coding and annotations, the visual will clarify relationships and reinforce the understanding of how the properties of convexity influence function behavior. \n\n**Objective:** Deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of convex functions by visually illustrating the essential characteristic that any line segment within a convex set does not violate the convexity condition, promoting a thorough grasp of the relationship between the graph of a function, its epigraph, and the real-world implications of these mathematical concepts.",
