    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The definition and characteristics of convex sets and their relationship to the epigraph of a function, and how this relates to the graphical representation of convex functions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their epigraphs in the context of graphical functions. The visualization should illustrate a convex set as a filled shape, emphasizing that any line segment connecting two points within the set remains entirely within it. Additionally, depict the graph of a convex function with its epigraph highlighted to show all points on or above the curve. An infographic style is recommended, incorporating simple annotations to clarify key concepts like \u201cconvex set,\u201d \u201cepigraph,\u201d and the visual property of line segments above the curve. This visualization will aid learners in understanding the relationship between the definitions, enhancing their ability to identify convex functions through graphical representation. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate convex sets and functions from non-convex ones by analyzing their graphical properties, reinforcing their comprehension through visual engagement with the concepts of epigraphs and boundary definitions in mathematics.",
