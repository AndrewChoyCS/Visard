    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The definition and characteristics of convex sets and how these are represented graphically through the concept of an epigraph of a function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and their epigraphs, illustrating how a function qualifies as convex. The goal is to visually depict a convex set with clear examples, including the graph of a convex function and the corresponding epigraph, which consists of all points above or on the curve. This visualization should highlight the critical relationship that any line segment connecting two points within the convex set remains above the graph of the function, reinforcing the concept of convexity. \n\nUse a combination of graphs and shaded areas to illustrate the epigraph, along with labels to clarify key aspects such as \"Convex Set,\" \"Function f,\" and \"Epigraph of f.\" An infographic style with engaging colors will enhance understanding while demonstrating the properties of convexity clearly. \n\n**Objective:** By the end of the visualization, learners should be able to clearly understand and identify the properties that define a convex set and to recognize how these properties apply to the epigraph of a function, reinforcing their ability to differentiate between convex and non-convex functions in both theoretical and practical contexts.",
