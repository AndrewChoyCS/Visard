    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of convexity in sets and functions, specifically how the epigraph of a function is a convex set, meaning that any line drawn between two points on the graph remains above the function itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the principle of convexity in sets and functions. The goal is to illustrate how a convex set is defined and to visually demonstrate the epigraph of a function and its relationship to the function itself. The visualization should clearly depict a graph of a function with the epigraph shaded to show all points on or above the curve, alongside lines connecting various points on the curve that remain above it, thereby highlighting the essence of convexity. Using a diagrammatic style will facilitate comparative analysis between convex and non-convex functions, emphasizing cause-effect relationships regarding whether a function meets the convexity criteria. This visual will deepen learners' understanding of the critical nature of convexity in optimization and mathematical analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and articulate the properties of convex sets and functions, recognizing the significance of the epigraph in defining convexity, and will effectively apply this understanding to analyze the behavior of functions in various mathematical contexts.",
