    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function \\( f \\) is convex if its epigraph (the region on or above the graph) is a convex set, meaning any straight line connecting two points within this set lies entirely inside the set.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and the epigraph of a function. The goal is to clearly illustrate how a convex function's epigraph behaves in relation to a straight line drawn between any two points on the graph. Specifically, the visualization should depict the graph of a function \\( f \\), highlighting the epigraph and demonstrating that any line segment connecting two points on this epigraph remains entirely above the graph itself. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a diagram that overlays the graph of a convex function with colored regions representing the epigraph and line segments connecting various points. This will guide learners in understanding the relationship between convexity and the epigraph, and reinforce the concept through visual representation. By using vivid colors and clear labeling, the visual should facilitate the recognition of the principles of convexity, helping students grasp the cause-and-effect relationship between the geometry of the graph and the properties of the epigraph.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of how the definition of convexity applies to functions through the visual representation of epigraphs, enhancing their ability to identify and explore convex sets graphically.",
