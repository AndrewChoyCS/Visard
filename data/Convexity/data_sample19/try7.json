    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The concept of a convex set and its relationship with the epigraph of a function, illustrating that all line segments drawn between points in a convex function lie above or on the graph of that function.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relation to the epigraph of a function. The goal is to clearly illustrate the definition of convexity by showing how any straight line connecting two points within a convex set lies entirely inside that set, as well as how the epigraph of a function comprises all points on or above its curve. This should include a graph of a convex function with its epigraph shaded, along with line segments drawn between points highlighting that they lie above the function. A diagrammatic approach could help in presenting these elements clearly, enabling learners to see the cause-effect relationship between the shape of the function and its convexity more intuitively.\n\n**Educational Outcomes**: \n1. Students will be able to identify and differentiate between convex and non-convex sets using visual examples.\n2. Learners will gain a solid understanding of how the epigraph of a function relates to the graph and what it means for a function to be convex.\n3. The visualization will enhance comprehension of the fundamental attribute that any line segment joining points within the convex set remains within the boundaries, reinforcing the concept of convexity through visual relationships. \n\nThis visualization should facilitate a deeper understanding by highlighting relationships rather than just definitions, encouraging learners to think critically about the principles of convexity in mathematical contexts.",
