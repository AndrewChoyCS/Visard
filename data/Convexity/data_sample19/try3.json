    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function in defining convexity.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to the epigraph of a function. The goal is to visually demonstrate how the definition of a convex set is illustrated through a graph of a function, highlighting the epigraph as all points above the curve. This visualization should clarify the key idea that a function is convex if its epigraph is a convex set, particularly showcasing how any line drawn between two points on the graph stays above the curve. \n\nAn effective style for this visualization could be a combination of interactive graphs and illustrative diagrams, clearly labeled to distinguish between the curve of the function, its epigraph, and the line segments that represent the definition. Using color coding could help differentiate between the function, the epigraph, and the line segments for better comprehension. By visually mapping these elements, the learner will gain an intuitive understanding of convexity and how it applies to functions, emphasizing the cause-effect relationship of line segments remaining above the function curve.\n\n**Objective:**\nDeeply understand the foundational concept of convexity by visualizing the properties and relationships of convex sets and their epigraphs, enabling learners to confidently identify and analyze the characteristics of convex functions in mathematical contexts.",
