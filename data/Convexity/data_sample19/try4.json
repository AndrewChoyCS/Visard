    "data": "To simplify matters, imagine convex sets as shapes in which any straight line connecting two points lies completely inside the set. This defines what we call a convex set. Now, consider the graph of a function f. The epigraph of this function comprises all points that are on or above the curve of the graph. A function f is referred to as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn across the graph will consistently reside at or above the representation of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of a convex set and its relationship with the epigraph of a function, illustrating that if a function's epigraph is a convex set, any line segment connecting two points on or above the graph lies at or above the curve.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function f. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how convex functions can be recognized through their epigraphs, showcasing that any line segment connecting two points within the epigraph remains above the graph of the function. This should include a graph illustrating a convex function, its epigraph shaded to denote the area above the curve, and several line segments connecting various points within the epigraph.\n\nThe visualization should employ a multi-part diagram combining graphical representations of the function, the epigraph, and the associated line segments to express the notion of convexity visually. By distinguishing between the function's curve and the shaded area of the epigraph, learners will better grasp the properties of convexity, including the critical idea that the entire set of points above the curve forms a convex set. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will gain a deep understanding of the concept of convexity in functions by visualizing how the properties of a convex set manifest in the epigraph, allowing them to identify and apply these principles in mathematical contexts effectively.",
