    "goal": "**Core Principle Extraction:**\nThe principle of separation between a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside of it, illustrated through the existence of a hyperplane or functional \\( x^* \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem, which posits that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and any point \\( x_0 \\) outside \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane \\( x^* \\) that strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the hyperplane divides the space between the point and the closed convex set, emphasizing the concept of separation in both 2D and 3D contexts. Key educational outcomes include a clear understanding of the geometric implications of the separation theorem, the role of the hyperplane in defining boundaries, and the concept of functional separation across dimensions. \n\nThe visualization should include labeled diagrams that show the convex set, the external point, and the separating hyperplane in both 2D (e.g., a simple graph) and 3D (e.g., a 3D space representation). An infographic style may be appropriate here, as it allows for intuitive interaction with the geometry involved. Highlighting the position of \\( x^* \\) relative to \\( x_0 \\) and \\( C \\) will help learners visualize the relationships and deepen their understanding of the infallibility of this theorem across various dimensions. \n\n**Objective:**\nTo foster a deep and crucial understanding of the Separation Theorem by visually demonstrating the role of hyperplanes in separating points from convex sets, thereby reinforcing the learner\u2019s grasp of the geometric underpinnings of convexity in various dimensional spaces.",
