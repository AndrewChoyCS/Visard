    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\n**The Separation Theorem: For any closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\notin C \\), there exists a hyperplane that strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\).**\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis. The goal is to depict a closed convex set \\( C \\), the point \\( x_0 \\) outside \\( C \\), and the hyperplane \\( x^* \\) that separates them. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the set, the point, and the hyperplane while illustrating the significance of the distance \\( \\delta \\) that ensures \\( x^* \\) strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from all points within \\( C \\).\n\nThe visualization can be designed as a labeled diagram showcasing \\( C \\) in varying dimensions (e.g., 2D and 3D) alongside hyperplane representation. Highlighting how \\( x_0 \\) is positioned relative to \\( C \\) and the resulting inequalities that define the separation will facilitate deeper comprehension. This will aid students in understanding both the geometric interpretation and mathematical implications of the theorem.\n\n### Objective:\nTo foster a profound understanding of the Separation Theorem by visually demonstrating the interaction between closed convex sets and external points, thus enabling learners to grasp the concept of duality in convex analysis and its applications in higher-dimensional spaces.",
