    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Separation Theorem for Closed Convex Sets**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem, illustrating how a hyperplane can separate a point outside a closed convex set from that set. The visualization should show a closed convex set \\( C \\) in a two-dimensional space, a point \\( x_0 \\) located outside of \\( C \\), and the hyperplane (or functional) \\( x^* \\) that distinctly separates \\( x_0 \\) from the points in \\( C \\). The goal is to clarify the relationship between the closed convex set, the external point, and the separating hyperplane, emphasizing the notion that this separation exists in any dimension. \n\nUtilizing a diagrammatic style would be effective, where the convex set is shaded, the external point is marked with a distinct color, and the hyperplane is drawn as a line with labels indicating the mathematical relationships described in the text (e.g., \\( \u27e8x^*, x_0\u27e9 + \u03b4 \u2264 \u27e8x^*, x\u27e9 \\)). This visual should clearly depict the spacing and relationship among these elements, thereby deepening learners' understanding of how duality and separation operate within convex geometry. \n\n**Learning Objective:** \nThe objective is to ensure that students grasp the concept of duality in convex sets, specifically how the Separation Theorem can be visually represented and applied in both finite and infinite dimensions, facilitating a clear understanding of the underlying geometric principles and their implications in higher-dimensional spaces.",
