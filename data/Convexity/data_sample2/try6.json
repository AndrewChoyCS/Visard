    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, illustrating the separation theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the separation theorem in convex analysis. The goal is to depict how a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside \\( C \\) can be separated by a hyperplane represented by a functional \\( x^* \\). This visualization should clarify the geometric relationship between these elements, illustrating that \\( x^* \\) effectively creates a boundary, ensuring that \\( x_0 \\) is on one side, while all points in \\( C \\) are on the other.\n\nTo achieve this, the visualization could consist of a diagram showcasing a two-dimensional plane with a closed convex set (e.g., a filled shape) and the point \\( x_0 \\) outside it. The hyperplane should be clearly marked, along with the respective inequalities that delineate \\( x_0 \\) from the set \\( C \\) (i.e., \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) for all \\( x \\in C \\)). Using different colors or shading can help emphasize the regions involved. \n\nThis visual representation should integrate best practices in instructional design by highlighting the cause-effect relationship (how the hyperplane separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\)), the sequential process of identifying points in relation to the hyperplane, and providing a clear comparative analysis of the locations of \\( x_0 \\) and \\( C \\). \n\n**Educational Outcomes Objective:** Encourage learners to develop a deep understanding of the separation theorem by visually exploring the geometric interactions between points and convex sets, reinforcing the abstract concepts through clear representation and intuitive insight into higher-dimensional implications.",
