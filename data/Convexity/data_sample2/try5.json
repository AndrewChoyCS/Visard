    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Separation Theorem in Convex Analysis**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem, which asserts that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane that distinctly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the closed convex set \\( C \\), the point \\( x_0 \\), and the separating hyperplane. The goal is to clarify how this separation holds in two-dimensional and potentially higher-dimensional spaces, emphasizing the geometric interpretation of the theorem. \n\nThe visualization should be a combination of diagrams depicting both R\u00b2 and a conceptual representation of higher dimensions, effectively showcasing how a hyperplane can separate a point from a set. By highlighting the geometric relationships and spatial arrangements, the visual aims to deepen understanding of the concept's robustness across various dimensions. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\nStudents should be able to:\n1. Identify and describe the components involved in the separation theorem (i.e., the closed convex set, the external point, and the hyperplane).\n2. Understand how geometric representations in lower dimensions can inform intuition about higher-dimensional cases.\n3. Recognize the implications of the theorem in practical applications, fostering a deeper grasp of duality in convex analysis.\n\nThis visualization style, combining clear, labeled diagrams with conceptual representations, enhances understanding by visually linking abstract mathematical concepts to concrete geometric interpretations.",
