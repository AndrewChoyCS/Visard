    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The ability of a hyperplane to strictly separate a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of hyperplane separation within closed convex sets as stated in the Separation Theorem. The goal is to illustrate how a hyperplane can distinguish a point \\( x_0 \\) that is outside a closed convex set \\( C \\) in both two-dimensional and higher-dimensional contexts. This visualization should clarify the specific relationship between the hyperplane, point \\( x_0 \\), and the set \\( C \\), emphasizing the condition that there exists a margin \\( \\delta \\) separating \\( x_0 \\) from the set \\( C \\). \n\nThe suggested visualization style could be a series of diagrams that depict 2D and 3D spaces, showcasing a closed convex set, the external point \\( x_0 \\), and the corresponding hyperplane defined by \\( x^* \\). The visual should include labeled axes, the convex set outlined in color, the hyperplane illustrated as a dashed line or plane, and annotations that highlight the separation condition. \n\nThis visualization will aid learners in understanding the geometric intuition behind separation in convex analysis, revealing the underlying principles of duality and the significance of hyperplanes in multidimensional spaces. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually grasp the concept of hyperplane separation, identify its implications in convex analysis, and apply this understanding to differentiate between points and convex sets in both finite and infinite dimensions.",
