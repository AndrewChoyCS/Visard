    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The Separation Theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and any point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or functional) that strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem by illustrating a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) located outside of \\( C \\). The goal of the visualization is to demonstrate how a hyperplane (or functional) \\( x^* \\) can be drawn to separate \\( x_0 \\) from all points \\( x \\) within the convex set \\( C \\). This will clarify the concept of separation in both finite and infinite dimensions, highlighting the relationship between \\( x_0 \\) and \\( C \\) through geometric representation.\n\nThe visualization should include a 2D diagram showcasing the convex set \\( C \\), the point \\( x_0 \\), and clearly labeled hyperplane \\( x^* \\), along with examples of how this applies in higher dimensions (e.g., through the use of dashed lines or additional planes). By using an infographic style, the visual will engage learners and systematically illustrate the cause-effect relationship between the point outside the convex set and the hyperplane that constructs the separation, reinforcing the concept's implications in various dimensions.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to achieve a deep understanding of the Separation Theorem, allowing students to visualize and comprehend the fundamental relationship between convex sets and external points in the context of duality, as well as apply this understanding to both practical and theoretical scenarios in convex analysis.",
