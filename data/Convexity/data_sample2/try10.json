    "goal": "**Core Principle for Visualization:** The separation of a point outside a closed convex set by a hyperplane in arbitrary dimensions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem, illustrating how a hyperplane separates a point \\( x_0 \\) from a closed convex set \\( C \\). The goal is to visually represent both the convex set and the separating hyperplane in a 2D or 3D space, providing a clear depiction of the mathematical relationships involved. This visual should specifically clarify the concept of separation, showing the conditions under which the hyperplane exists and intersects with \\( C \\).\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a diagram where the closed convex set is prominently displayed, with \\( x_0 \\) marked outside it. A line or plane (the hyperplane) should be clearly labeled, demonstrating how it divides the space into two distinct regions\u2014one containing \\( x_0 \\) and the other containing points within \\( C \\). It should also include annotations to highlight the vector \\( x^* \\) and the relationship encapsulated in the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\), enhancing learners' understanding of these mathematical relationships.\n\nThis visual aids in comprehending not just the separation process, but also emphasizes the essential properties of convex sets and the nature of hyperplanes in multidimensional spaces, thus fostering a deep and nuanced understanding of the concept. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will achieve a thorough understanding of the Separation Theorem by visually grasping how hyperplanes act as separators in higher-dimensional spaces, enabling them to apply this concept in varying contexts within convexity theory.",
