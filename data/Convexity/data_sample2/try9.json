    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The Separation Theorem in convex analysis states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and any point \\( x_0 \\) not in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane that strictly separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis. The visual aims to illustrate the relationship between a closed convex set \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the hyperplane that separates them. Specifically, it should depict how the hyperplane (represented by a line in 2D or a plane in 3D) demonstrates the idea of separation, marking the regions outside and inside the convex set. \n\nUtilize a diagram style that includes labeled axes, the convex set, the separating hyperplane, and the point \\( x_0 \\). The visual should clarify the condition that the hyperplane not only separates but does so with a margin \\( \\delta > 0 \\) shown graphically for better clarity. \n\nThis visualization serves to deepen understanding by showing spatial relationships and geometric properties essential to the theorem, making abstract concepts more tangible. The objective is to foster a crucial understanding of how duality and separation play a pivotal role in convex analysis, enhancing learners' grasp of geometric arrangements in multidimensional spaces.",
