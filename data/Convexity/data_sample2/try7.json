    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, as stated in the Separation Theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of hyperplane separation in the Separation Theorem. The goal is to illustrate how a hyperplane (represented graphically) can effectively divide a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside of a closed convex set \\( C \\) from all the points within \\( C \\). This visualization should clearly depict the hyperplane, the point \\( x_0 \\), and the convex set, using 2D and 3D representations to show that this separation concept holds in multiple dimensions. \n\nTo clarify the relationships between the elements, utilize a diagrammatic style where the hyperplane is visually distinct and labeled, emphasizing its role as a separator, and include annotations that demonstrate the mathematical inequalities derived from the theorem. By representing this visual structure, learners will better comprehend the underlying idea of convexity and separability, fostering a deeper understanding of duality in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually articulate and mathematically justify the concept of hyperplane separation in convex analysis, recognizing how the geometric representation illuminates the properties of closed convex sets and the conditions outlined in the Separation Theorem.",
