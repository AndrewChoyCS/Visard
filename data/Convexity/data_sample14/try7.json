    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the values of a convex function at the endpoints of an interval and its value at the midpoint, along with the implications of the non-negativity of its second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how a convex function behaves, specifically demonstrating that the value at the midpoint of any interval is always less than or equal to the average of the function values at the endpoints. Additionally, the visualization should show how the second derivative being non-negative indicates the function's convexity. This could be achieved through a series of graphs showing a convex function with highlighted midpoints and endpoint values, alongside annotations indicating the average of the endpoints. The visualization should employ a clear line graph style with annotations and color-coded regions to delineate the convexity criterion. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will gain a deep understanding of how to determine whether a function is convex through visual representations of the midpoint condition and the significance of the second derivative. By seeing the relationships between these points, along with the implications illustrated graphically, students will be equipped to recognize and apply the concept of convexity in various mathematical contexts. \n\n**Objective:** To enhance learners' critical understanding of convex functions by visualizing the relationships between function values at midpoints versus endpoints, thereby fostering a robust comprehension of the geometric and calculus-based criteria that characterize convexity.",
