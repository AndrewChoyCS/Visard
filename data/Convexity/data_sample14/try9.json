    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between the midpoint value of a convex function and the average of endpoint values, together with the significance of a non-negative second derivative.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between the values of a convex function at endpoints and its midpoint, emphasizing the criterion of convexity through the second derivative. The visualization should clearly illustrate how, for any interval within the function's domain, the value at the midpoint is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints, using a graph that plots both scenarios. Additionally, incorporate a visual representation of the second derivative remaining non-negative, potentially through a dual-axis graph or overlays, where one axis depicts the function and the other its second derivative. This approach aims to reinforce the cause-effect relationship between the characteristics of convexity and the behavior of the function's second derivative while illustrating sequential progression within the function's domain. \n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:** Learners will develop a deep and profound understanding of convex functions by visualizing how the midpoint and endpoints interact, linking to the critical role of the second derivative in determining convexity, thereby cementing their grasp of the fundamental principles of convexity in mathematical functions.",
