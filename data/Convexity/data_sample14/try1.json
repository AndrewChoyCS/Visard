    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between the values of a convex function at the midpoint of an interval and the average of the values at its endpoints, as well as the significance of the non-negativity of the second derivative in determining convexity.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the properties of a convex function, specifically illustrating how the value at the midpoint of an interval compares to the average of the values at its endpoints. The visualization should include a graph that depicts a sample convex function, highlighting the midpoint and endpoints clearly. Alongside the graph, a secondary visual should show the corresponding second derivative and its non-negativity across the interval [a,b], emphasizing how this criterion confirms the convexity of the function.\n\nThe goal is to clarify the fundamental concept of convexity in functions by depicting the relationship between midpoint values and endpoint averages, while also illustrating the condition of the second derivative. The educational outcomes expected include a deep understanding of how convex functions behave and the mathematical criteria used to identify them. Using line graphs with color-coded sections for clarity will enhance comprehension and reinforce critical relationships within the principle. \n\n**Objective:** Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of convex functions by visualizing the connections between midpoint values and endpoint averages, as well as the implications of the second derivative\u2019s non-negativity, fostering a robust grasp of both concept and application in mathematical contexts.",
