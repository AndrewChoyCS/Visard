    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between the values of a convex function at the midpoint and its endpoints, along with the implication of the non-negativity of the second derivative as a criterion for convexity.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically focusing on the relationship between the values of a convex function at the midpoint of an interval and the average of the values at its endpoints. The goal of the visualization is to clarify how the condition of f((x1 + x2)/2) \u2264 (f(x1) + f(x2))/2 reflects the nature of convex functions. Additionally, incorporate a graph illustrating the behavior of the second derivative f''(x) to reinforce the criterion for convexity over the interval [a, b]. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a combination of a graph illustrating both a convex function and its midpoint condition alongside a section highlighting the second derivative. By integrating these elements, learners can visually grasp how a function's shape is determined by these criteria, deepening their understanding of convexity. \n\n**Objective**: Learners will be able to identify and apply the conditions for convexity in mathematical functions, recognizing the importance of midpoints and second derivatives in defining a convex shape, thus enhancing their analytical skills in function behavior.",
