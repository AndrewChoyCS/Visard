    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The defining characteristic of a convex function, specifically that the value at the midpoint of any interval is less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints, and the requirement that the second derivative must be non-negative for a function to be considered convex.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions, particularly focusing on how the value at the midpoint of an interval compares to the average of the values at the endpoints. This visualization should also incorporate the relationship between the second derivative and the convexity of the function. Through graphs, one should depict a convex function along with marked points at the endpoints and the midpoint, demonstrating the required condition visually, along with a side-by-side graphic illustrating how the second derivative is non-negative across the interval [a, b]. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the graphical representation of the function and its mathematical properties, highlighting how these aspects confirm convexity. The use of a combination of line graphs and annotations will help students see the direct cause-effect relationship between the location of points on the curve, their averages, and the implications of the second derivative's sign. \n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:** Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the properties of convex functions manifest graphically, enabling them to identify and analyze convexity criteria in various functions with confidence and clarity. By engaging with the visual representation, learners should be able to articulate the significance of midpoint values and second derivatives in establishing function convexity.",
