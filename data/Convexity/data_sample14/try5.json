    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition and characteristics of a convex function, particularly the relationship between the function values at the endpoints of an interval and the midpoint, as well as the significance of non-negative second derivatives.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of a convex function, highlighting both its defining property and the relationship between the function's second derivative and its convexity. The visualization should clearly illustrate how, for any interval within a convex function, the value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints. Additionally, depict the significance of the second derivative being non-negative, ensuring that this relationship is visually linked to the shape of the function graph. \n\nUtilize a combination of line graphs to represent a convex function and annotated diagrams to show how the midpoints relate to the endpoints. Include clear labels for intervals, midpoints, and the second derivative. This visual will help learners grasp the essential idea that convexity is inherently linked to the function's curvature, promoting a clear understanding of cause-effect relationships in calculus. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will deepen their understanding of convex functions by visualizing the fundamental properties that define them, thereby enhancing their ability to analyze and differentiate convex functions based on their graphical representations and behavior of derivatives.",
