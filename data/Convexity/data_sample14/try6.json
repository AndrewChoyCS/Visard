    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between the values of a convex function at the endpoints of an interval and their midpoint, as well as the criterion based on the second derivative for confirming convexity.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically highlighting how the value at the midpoint of any interval is related to the average of the endpoint values. The visual should include a graph of a convex function, with clearly marked endpoints and their midpoint, demonstrating that the midpoint is always less than or equal to the average of the endpoints. Additionally, incorporate a plot of the second derivative over the same interval, showing how it remains non-negative to confirm the convexity of the function. \n\nThis visualization should adopt an infographic style to effectively communicate these relationships and criteria visually, helping learners grasp both the graphical representation and the mathematical principles behind convexity. By emphasizing the relationship between the function's values and using color-coded segments to represent monotonic regions where the second derivative is non-negative, the visual will deepen understanding and retention of these key concepts.\n\n**Learning Objective:** \nStudents will be able to articulate the defining properties of convex functions, recognize the significance of the midpoint value compared to endpoint averages, and apply the criterion of the second derivative to establish convexity, thereby fostering a comprehensive understanding of function behavior in real analysis.",
