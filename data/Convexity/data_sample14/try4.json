    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The definition of a convex function and the geometric interpretation of its second derivative being non-negative as a criterion for convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and the significance of their second derivative in determining convexity. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the values of a convex function at the midpoints of intervals compare to the averages of the endpoints, and how this correlates with the non-negativity of the second derivative. The visualization should effectively depict the relationship between midpoints and endpoint averages, using a graph to showcase a sample convex function and its second derivative.\n\nTo achieve this, consider using a combination of line graphs and shaded regions. The main graph can show a convex function with marked points at endpoints and midpoints, clearly indicating the average value at the endpoints and comparing it to the midpoint value. Additionally, include a secondary graph that displays the second derivative of the function, highlighting areas where it is non-negative. This dual representation will enable learners to visualize the criterion for convexity in a coherent manner.\n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:** Students will deeply understand the relationship between the geometric properties of convex functions and their mathematical criteria, specifically how the non-negativity of the second derivative aligns with the intuitive concept of a function being convex. This understanding will enable learners to identify and analyze convex functions effectively in various mathematical contexts.",
