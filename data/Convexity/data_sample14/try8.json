    "data": "A convex function is defined as a continuous function where the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain is always less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints of that interval. If a function f(x) possesses a second derivative across the interval [a,b], then a prerequisite and a conclusive criterion for its convexity over that span is that the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for every x within the range [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe relationship between the midpoint value of a convex function and the average of its endpoint values, along with the criterion that the second derivative must be non-negative for convexity.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions, focusing on how the value at the midpoint of an interval relates to the averages of its endpoints and the role of the second derivative in determining convexity. The visualization should include graphs of a specific convex function along with marked points indicating the function's values at the endpoints, the midpoint, and the average of the endpoints. Additionally, a second graph should illustrate the second derivative, clearly indicating where it remains non-negative across the interval. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between these values and how they underpin the definition of convexity. By integrating graphs that visually represent these mathematical principles, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the criteria that define convex functions, reinforcing their knowledge of continuity and differentiability in functions. \n\nKey educational outcomes include the ability to identify convex functions through graphical analysis and to understand the significance of the second derivative in verifying convexity. This visualization could best be styled as an infographic that combines visual elements like graphs, color coding for different regions, and clear labels, allowing students to visually grasp the cause-effect relationships inherent in convexity. \n\n**Objective:**\nTo develop a profound understanding of convex functions by illustrating the essential relationship between midpoint values, endpoints, and the conditions for convexity through visual representation, enabling learners to apply these concepts to identify and analyze convex functions in both theoretical and practical contexts.",
