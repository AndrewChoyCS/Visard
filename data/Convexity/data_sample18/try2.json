    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A convex set is defined by the property that any straight line segment connecting two points within the set remains entirely within the set; for a function, its epigraph is convex if it remains above the function's graph.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship with the epigraph of a function. The goal is to illustrate how any line segment between two points in a convex set remains contained within that set, alongside a graph of a function demonstrating its convex epigraph. Use a combination of a clear diagram overlaying a convex set with line segments connecting points, and a graph showing the function with shaded areas representing its epigraph. \n\nThis visualization should use color coding to differentiate between the set, the line segments, and the epigraph, enhancing the learner's comprehension of the relationships between these elements. The use of comparative analysis through contrasting convex and non-convex shapes would be included to solidify understanding of convexity. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and explain the properties that distinguish convex sets and their epigraphs, recognizing the visual characteristics that affirm their definitions, thereby fostering a deeper conceptual understanding of convexity in geometry and mathematical functions.",
