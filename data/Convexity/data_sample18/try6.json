    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The definition and properties of convex sets, specifically how a straight line connecting two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set, and the relationship of this concept to the epigraph of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to the epigraph of a function. The visualization should illustrate how any straight line between two points within a convex set remains contained within that set, complemented by a graph of a convex function showing its epigraph. The goal is to clarify that a function is convex if its epigraph is also a convex set, emphasizing the significance of the relationship between the function\u2019s graph and the straight lines drawn across it. \n\nThe visual could include a diagram with labeled components delineating a convex shape, the epigraph of a function, and examples of both convex and non-convex functions. It should incorporate clear annotations to highlight cause-effect relationships, such as how the convexity of the epigraph relates to the properties of the function itself. This approach would deepen the learner's understanding by portraying the foundational geometric properties of convexity in a contextual and accessible manner.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will demonstrate a deep understanding of convex sets and functions by identifying the properties of convexity through visual representation, applying these concepts to analyze epigraphs, and recognizing the implications of the convex property in real-world applications, thereby enhancing their grasp of fundamental mathematical concepts.",
