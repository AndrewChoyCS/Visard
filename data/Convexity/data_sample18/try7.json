    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe core principle is that a function is classified as convex if its epigraph, which includes all points on or above its graph, forms a convex set. This implies that any straight line segment connecting two points on the graph remains at or above the curve.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and their epigraphs. The goal is to illustrate how a convex function's graph and its corresponding epigraph demonstrate the key characteristic of convexity, whereby any straight line between points on the graph stays above or on the curve. This visualization should clearly depict the relationship between the function, its graph, and the epigraph, using styles such as diagrams with labeled sections, color-coding for clarity, and contrasting line segments to highlight the convexity feature. \n\nUtilizing these visual elements will aid in clearly conveying the definition of convex sets and functions, as well as emphasizing the critical relationship between the function's properties and its epigraph. \n\n**Objective:**\nBy the end of this visual presentation, learners will be able to articulate the defining characteristics of convex functions and understand how the geometric representation of their epigraph substantiates the concept of convexity in mathematical functions.",
