    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The defining characteristic of convex sets, specifically that any straight line connecting two points within a convex set remains entirely contained within that set, and its relation to the epigraph of a function indicating whether a function is convex.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship with convex functions through their epigraphs. The visualization should clearly illustrate a convex set as a shape (e.g., a simple geometric shape like a circle or ellipse) alongside a graph of a convex function. Key elements should include straight line segments connecting various points within the convex set, demonstrating that they remain inside the shape, and the epigraph of the function highlighting points above the graph. \n\nThis visual aims to clarify the fundamental property of convexity and how it manifests in both geometrical and functional contexts. Using a diagram style that engages learners through color-coded lines and labeled diagrams will facilitate a deeper understanding of relationships between convexity and epigraphs, promoting comparative analysis of convex vs. non-convex shapes/functions. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and explain the properties of convex sets and functions, recognizing the significance of the epigraph in determining convexity, allowing them to apply this understanding in geometric and functional analyses.",
