    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The characteristic of convex sets and the relationship with the epigraph of a convex function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship with the epigraph of a convex function. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how any straight line connecting two points within a convex set remains contained within that set, as well as to demonstrate how the epigraph, comprising all points above a function's graph, also forms a convex set for a convex function. The visualization should include graphical representations of convex shapes and a function graph, highlighting the lines that remain within the convex set and above the function's curve. Use clear labeling and color coding to differentiate between points within the convex set and the epigraph, facilitating a comparative analysis that showcases the cause-effect relationships between the shape of the function and its classification as convex. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually interpret and explain the characteristics of convex sets and how the epigraph of a convex function reinforces the definition of convexity, fostering a deeper understanding of geometric and mathematical relationships inherent in convexity concepts.",
