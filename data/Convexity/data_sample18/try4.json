    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extraction:** The defining characteristic of convex sets, where any straight line between two points within the set remains fully contained within that set, and the relationship between a convex function and its epigraph.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship with convex functions and epigraphs. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the defining property of convexity, specifically showing that any line segment connecting two points within a convex set remains entirely contained within that set. Additionally, the visualization should depict how the epigraph of a convex function captures all points above its graph, helping to clarify why a function is classified as convex. \n\nThe visual should incorporate a clear diagram showcasing both a convex set (such as a convex polygon) and a graph of a convex function with its corresponding epigraph. Use color coding to differentiate between the convex set, the function graph, and the epigraph, while including labeled segments and annotations to highlight the properties of each. This approach will facilitate the understanding of the relationships between convex sets, their epigraphs, and convex functions, enabling learners to recognize how these concepts interconnect.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will achieve a profound understanding of convexity by visualizing the relational dynamics within convex sets and functions, allowing for an intuitive grasp of the foundational geometric properties that define these concepts.",
