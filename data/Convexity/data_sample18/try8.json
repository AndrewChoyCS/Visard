    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A convex set is defined by the property that any straight line connecting two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set, and a function is convex if its epigraph is also a convex set.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in sets and functions. The goal is to illustrate the defining property of convex sets through simple geometric shapes, alongside a graph that represents a convex function and its epigraph. By visualizing lines drawn between points within the convex set and demonstrating how they remain inside the shape, learners will develop an intuitive understanding of what constitutes a convex set. Additionally, the visualization should highlight the relationship between the function and its epigraph, showing that convex functions maintain the property that line segments drawn across their graphs lie above the curve. \n\nTo effectively convey these relationships, consider using an infographic style that integrates geometric shapes for convex sets, market lines, and a graph of a convex function with labeled points and the corresponding epigraph. This will solidify learners' understanding of how the convexity of a function relates to its epigraph being a convex set while empowering them to compare and contrast different shapes and functions. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to clearly identify and articulate the characteristics of convex sets and convex functions, understanding how these concepts are interrelated and visually represented, thereby enhancing their comprehension of mathematical visualization in the context of convexity.",
