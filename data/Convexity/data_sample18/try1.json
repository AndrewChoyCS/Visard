    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extraction:**\nThe concept that convex sets maintain the property that any straight line drawn between two points within the set remains completely contained within the set is crucial for understanding both the nature of convex sets and the classification of functions as convex based on their epigraphs.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the properties of convex sets, specifically illustrating the defining characteristics of a convex set and its epigraph in relation to a convex function. The visualization should feature diagrams showing various convex shapes, along with line segments drawn between points within these shapes to highlight the defining characteristic. Additionally, display a graph of a convex function with its epigraph visually portrayed, with lines drawn across the graph to demonstrate that they stay on or above the curve.\n\nThe goals of this visualization are to clarify the nature of convex sets and functions, emphasize the visual criteria for convexity, and illustrate how the epigraph of a function relates to its classification as convex. By using diagrams and graphs, the visualization will aid in understanding the relationships between the geometric shapes and their functional representations, fostering deeper insight into the concept of convexity.\n\n**Objective:**\nDevelop a clear and deep understanding of the properties and implications of convexity in sets and functions, ensuring that learners can visualize and articulate the criteria for convexity through effective visual representations. This will empower students to analyze and identify convex sets and functions in mathematical contexts confidently.",
