    "data": "To simplify the concept, convex sets can be visualized as shapes in which any straight line connected between two points within the set remains entirely contained in that set. This characteristic defines a convex set. In relation to a function f, an epigraph consists of all points that lie on or are above the function's graph. A function f is classified as convex if its epigraph also forms a convex set, signifying that every line segment that is drawn across its graph stays on or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The definition and properties of convex sets and their epigraphs related to convex functions.\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their relationship to convex functions through their epigraphs. The goal of this visualization is to clearly depict the definition of convex sets, illustrating that any straight line connecting two points within the set remains entirely within the set. Additionally, include a graph of a convex function and its epigraph, highlighting how all line segments drawn across the graph remain above the curve. \n\nFocus on visualizing the relationships between convex sets, their defining properties, and how they relate to the concept of convexity in functions. Suggested styles could include an infographic that combines diagrams of convex shapes and graphical representations of functions, emphasizing cause-effect relationships (e.g., how the properties of convex sets manifest in functions) and comparative analysis (e.g., contrasting convex vs. non-convex functionalities). \n\nThis visual aims to deepen understanding by providing clear examples and reinforcing the critical notion that the characteristics of convex sets and functions are closely intertwined, thus fostering a more sophisticated comprehension of convexity in mathematical contexts. \n\n**Objective:** Students should be able to identify and articulate the characteristics of convex sets and functions, recognizing how the epigraph of a function maintains these properties, thereby enhancing their understanding of the implications of convexity in various mathematical applications.",
