    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y).** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how, for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within a convex set, the values of the function \\( f \\) at convex combinations of these points stay below or on the line connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\). Key educational outcomes expected include a clear understanding of the relationship between the geometric representation of convex functions and the mathematical inequalities that define them. \n\nThe visualization should ideally be a multi-layered diagram that features plots of the function \\( f \\) along with points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), emphasizing the convex combinations (e.g., \u03bb = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4) as intermediate points on the curve. Incorporating color-coded lines to represent the inequalities can help further clarify the concept. This style allows learners to see the continuous nature of the function, demonstrating how convexity is preserved across combinations of points. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of convex functions by visualizing how the relationship between function values and linear interpolations reveals the inherent properties of convexity, equipping students to apply this concept in practical scenarios.",
