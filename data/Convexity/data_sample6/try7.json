    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convexity condition for a function, which states that for any points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in its domain and any \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\), the inequality \\( f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda)f(y) \\) holds true.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly highlighting the relationship defined by the convexity condition. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the function value at a convex combination of two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of their function values \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\). \n\nThe visualization should include a 3D graph of a convex function with points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), as well as the line segment connecting these two points. A separate inset should show the specific case of \\( \\lambda = 1/2 \\), highlighting the midpoint and how the function value at this midpoint relates to the convexity condition. \n\nUsing a clean, infographic style, this visual will help learners grasp the cause-effect relationship inherent in the convexity condition, making clear how convex functions behave in relation to linear combinations of points in their domain. The expected educational outcomes include a reinforced understanding of the geometric interpretation of convexity and the ability to visually identify convex functions. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of the definition and implications of convexity in functions, enabling learners to visualize the relationships between points, the function, and the geometric constraints that characterize convexity.",
