    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The defining inequality for convex functions, specifically illustrating how the value of a function at any convex combination of two points is less than or equal to the corresponding convex combination of their function values.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the convexity condition of a function defined on a convex set. The visualization should clearly depict two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a 2D plane, along with their corresponding function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). Illustrate the convex combination \\(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y\\) for \\(\u03bb\\) within the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Highlight the line segment connecting \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) and show how it remains above the surface defined by \\(f\\) in the region between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nThe goal of the visualization is to clarify the relationship between the points \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and their function values, emphasizing the inequality \\(f(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 - \u03bb)f(y)\\). The educational outcome expected is a deep understanding of how convex functions maintain this property geometrically, reinforcing the concept of convexity as a fundamental aspect of optimization and analysis.\n\n**Visualization Styles Suggested**: A combination of diagram and 3D graph to represent the surface of the function in relation to the line segment connecting function values.\n\n**Objective**: By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a clear and intuitive understanding of convex functions, enhancing their ability to recognize and apply the convexity condition in various mathematical contexts, particularly in optimization problems.",
