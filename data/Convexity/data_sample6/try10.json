    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe inequality for convex functions, which states that for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the domain, the function value at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values at those points.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how the inequality \\( f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f(y) \\) holds for any points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) values between 0 and 1. This visualization should clarify the geometric interpretation of convexity, showing how the line connecting the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) stays above the curve of the function \\( f \\). \n\nUse a combination of graphs and diagrams: one graph should depict the function \\( f \\) overlaid with the line segment connecting the two points, while additional markers indicate various \\( \\lambda \\) values that represent convex combinations. Incorporating color-coded regions can help illustrate the area where the function maintains the inequality across different \\( \\lambda \\) values. This approach aids learners in grasping the relationship between points, function values, and the geometric implications of convexity, allowing for deeper insights into how these mathematical properties interrelate.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will be able to visually and intuitively understand the concept of convex functions by recognizing the relationship between input points, function values, and geometric representation, thereby enabling them to apply these principles in both theoretical and practical contexts effectively.",
