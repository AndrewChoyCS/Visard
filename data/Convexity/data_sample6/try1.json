    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The principle of convexity in functions, specifically visualizing how a convex function's graph ensures that the value at any convex combination of two points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of their function values.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, illustrating the relationship between points on the graph of a convex function and their corresponding values. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the geometric meaning of the convexity condition: that for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the value of the function at any point on the line segment connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) remains below the line joining these two points. \n\nThis will be achieved through a diagram that includes the graph of a convex function, the selected points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) on the x-axis, the line segment between \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), and a visual representation of the point \\( \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y \\) for \\( \\lambda \\) in [0, 1]. Additional annotations and labels should highlight the inequalities involved, showing their geometric implications.\n\nBy integrating clear labels, color-coding, and an interactive component (if applicable), this visualization will facilitate a deeper understanding of relationships between convex combinations and function values, enabling learners to grasp the essential nature of convexity in mathematical functions.\n\n**Educational Objective:** \nTo ensure students can adeptly recognize and apply the principles of convexity when analyzing functions, comprehending how the geometric properties of a convex function manifest through inequalities of function values and their convex combinations, thus bridging theoretical concepts with visual intuition.",
