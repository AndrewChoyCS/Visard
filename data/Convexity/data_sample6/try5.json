    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions.** The visualization should depict the geometric interpretation of convex functions, illustrating how the line segment connecting any two points on the function\u2019s graph remains above the graph itself. Highlight the relationship between the function values at points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and those at any convex combination of these points, \\(f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda) y)\\). The goal is to clarify how the convexity condition \\(f(\\lambda x + (1\u2212\u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1\u2212\u03bb)f(y)\\) manifests graphically.\n\nTo achieve this, utilize a diagram that includes a 3D representation of a convex function, with labeled points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the line segment connecting them, and the corresponding convex combination point. This visualization will employ color coding to differentiate between the function value at the convex combination and the linear combination of the function values at \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Employing this style will foster a clear understanding of the relationship between the geometric representation of convexity and the mathematical definition, thus facilitating deep learning of the concept.\n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the convexity of functions by recognizing and interpreting the geometric implications of the convexity condition in a graphical format, enhancing their ability to visualize mathematical concepts in multi-dimensional spaces.",
