    "data": "A function f : R^n \u2192 R is classified as convex if it is defined on a convex set and satisfies the condition that for any points x and y in its domain, and for every \u03bb within the interval [0, 1], the inequality f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) holds true. This implies that for any two points x and y, the value of f at any convex combination of these points does not exceed the corresponding convex combination of the function values f(x) and f(y). Thus, geometrically, the line that connects the points (x, f(x)) to (y, f(y)) remains above the surface defined by f. Additionally, if the function f is continuous, it suffices to verify this convexity condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any fixed \u03bb in the interval (0, 1)). This is akin to what we previously discussed regarding midpoint convex sets. A function is considered concave if the function -f exhibits convexity.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The convexity condition of a function f, specifically the graphical representation that illustrates how the function\u2019s value at a convex combination of two points does not exceed the weighted sum of its values at those points.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to clearly demonstrate how the value of a convex function at any convex combination between two points is always less than or equal to the corresponding convex combination of the function values at those points. This visualization should highlight the relationship between the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)), illustrating the geometric interpretation that the line segment connecting these points lies above the surface of the function f. Suggestions for visualization styles include a combination of a 3D graph to depict the function surface and a 2D plot showing the connecting line, along with labeled points and annotations to clarify each component.\n\nThe visual should aid in understanding the concept of convexity by focusing on the relationships between the points and the function values, thereby enhancing learners\u2019 ability to grasp the cause-and-effect relationship of the convexity condition. The key educational outcome expected is a deep understanding of how convex functions operate, particularly how convex combinations preserve the inequality that defines convexity, which is essential for further studies in optimization and economic theory.",
