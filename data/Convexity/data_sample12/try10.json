    "data": "A fundamental result in convex analysis known as the duality theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\), if there exists a point \\( x_0 \\) not included in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or a linear functional \\( x^* \\) in the dual space \\( X^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). While it may appear straightforward in two-dimensional space, this principle is valid in any dimensionality, including infinite dimensions. This concept is often termed the geometric version of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which encompasses a variety of related inequalities. Theorem 3.5, recognized as the Separation Theorem, asserts that if \\( C \\subset X \\) is a closed convex set and \\( x_0 \\in X \\setminus C \\), there exists a non-zero functional \\( x^* \\in X^* \\) and a positive scalar \\( \\delta \\) such that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds. This effectively indicates that \\( x^* \\) serves to separate \\( x_0 \\) from the set \\( C \\).",
    "goal": "**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of the duality theorem in convex analysis, specifically focusing on the Separation Theorem. The visualization should clearly illustrate a closed convex set \\( C \\) in a multi-dimensional space and a point \\( x_0 \\) excluded from this set. A hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)) should be depicted clearly separating \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\), along with an annotated representation of the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\). \n\nThis visualization aims to clarify how the Separation Theorem demonstrates the existence of a hyperplane that effectively separates points outside a convex set from those inside, thereby deepening understanding of convexity and duality. By showcasing the relationships between the convex set, point, hyperplane, and the functional, the visual can help learners grasp cause-effect relationships and the fundamental properties of convex analysis.\n\nThe visualization style should be a diagram with labeled arrows to denote relationships and sections, enhancing clarity and focus. This approach aids in deepening understanding by allowing learners to visually process the separation of elements, revealing the hierarchical structure of the theorem, and emphasizing the significance of convexity in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will gain a profound understanding of how the duality theorem and the Separation Theorem operate, enabling them to visualize and articulate the relationships between points in convex spaces and hyperplanes in higher dimensions.",
