    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis and its duality aspect.** The goal is to depict a closed convex set \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the separating hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)). The visualization should clearly illustrate the relationship between point \\( x_0 \\), set \\( C \\), and the hyperplane, showcasing how the hyperplane effectively separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). \n\nKey educational outcomes expected include a deep understanding of the concept of separation in convex analysis and the geometric interpretation of the duality theorem. \n\nThe visualization should use a diagrammatic style, illustrating the closed convex set as a shaded region, the point \\( x_0 \\) as an external point, and a dashed line representing the hyperplane. Incorporating arrows and labels can highlight the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\), reinforcing how \\( x^* \\) functions as a separator and how the positioning of \\( x_0 \\) relative to \\( C \\) underlines its significance. \n\nThis clear visual representation supports learners in grasping cause-effect relationships, helping them understand how external points relate to convex sets and the implications for convex analysis. Objective: To understand the mechanics of separation in convex analysis, emphasizing how geometric constructs facilitate the interpretation of theoretical principles in infinite-dimensional spaces.",
