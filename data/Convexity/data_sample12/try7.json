    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a hyperplane (or linear functional) that separates a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself, illustrating the Separation Theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of the Separation Theorem in convex analysis. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how a hyperplane (representing the linear functional \\( x^* \\)) separates a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside a closed convex set \\( C \\). The visualization should depict both the convex set \\( C \\) and the point \\( x_0 \\), along with the separating hyperplane, clearly labeled to illustrate their relationships. \n\nUsing a diagram style that differentiates between the convex set, the external point, and the hyperplane, include color coding to enhance clarity. The visual should highlight the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) to show how the hyperplane provides a margin of separation, effectively demonstrating the inequalities involved in the theorem.\n\nThis visual aid will help learners grasp the fundamental geometric relationship and spatial reasoning involved in the concept, reinforcing their understanding by illustrating how separation occurs across various dimensions. \n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners will be able to articulate and visually interpret the Separation Theorem, understanding how hyperplanes can be used to separate points from closed convex sets, thereby deepening their grasp of convexity concepts and their applications in both finite and infinite dimensions.",
