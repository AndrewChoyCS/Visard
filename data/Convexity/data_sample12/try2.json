    "data": "A fundamental result in convex analysis known as the duality theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\), if there exists a point \\( x_0 \\) not included in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or a linear functional \\( x^* \\) in the dual space \\( X^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). While it may appear straightforward in two-dimensional space, this principle is valid in any dimensionality, including infinite dimensions. This concept is often termed the geometric version of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which encompasses a variety of related inequalities. Theorem 3.5, recognized as the Separation Theorem, asserts that if \\( C \\subset X \\) is a closed convex set and \\( x_0 \\in X \\setminus C \\), there exists a non-zero functional \\( x^* \\in X^* \\) and a positive scalar \\( \\delta \\) such that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds.

    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The existence of a separating hyperplane (or linear functional) that distinguishes a point outside a closed convex set from the set itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of separating hyperplanes in convex analysis, as articulated by the duality theorem. The visualization should depict a closed convex set \\( C \\) in a two-dimensional space, along with a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\) and the associated hyperplane defined by the linear functional \\( x^* \\). The goal is to clarify how this hyperplane effectively delineates \\( x_0 \\) from all points within \\( C \\). \n\nFor the design, consider using a clear diagram with labeled axes, the set \\( C \\) shaded to indicate its convexity, the point \\( x_0 \\) marked distinctly, and the hyperplane illustrated as a dashed line with directional arrows indicating its separation effect. Integrate arrows to represent the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) to highlight the relational aspect of the theorem. \n\nBy emphasizing the geometric representation of these relationships, the visualization aids in understanding the fundamental nature of convex sets and the concept of separation in higher dimensions. \n\n**Educational Objective:** To enable learners to grasp the significance of the duality theorem in convex analysis by visualizing the relationship between closed convex sets and points external to them, fostering a deeper understanding of linear functionals and their applications in various dimensional spaces.",
