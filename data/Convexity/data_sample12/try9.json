    "data": "A fundamental result in convex analysis known as the duality theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\), if there exists a point \\( x_0 \\) not included in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or a linear functional \\( x^* \\) in the dual space \\( X^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). While it may appear straightforward in two-dimensional space, this principle is valid in any dimensionality, including infinite dimensions. This concept is often termed the geometric version of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which encompasses a variety of related inequalities. Theorem 3.5, recognized as the Separation Theorem, asserts that if \\( C \\subset X \\) is a closed convex set and \\( x_0 \\in X \\setminus C \\), there exists a non-zero functional \\( x^* \\in X^* \\) and a positive scalar \\( \\delta \\) such that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds.

    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The Separation Theorem in convex analysis establishes that a closed convex set \\( C \\) can be separated from a point \\( x_0 \\) not in \\( C \\) by a hyperplane (or a linear functional), highlighting the relationship between convex sets and linear functionals.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationship between a closed convex set \\( C \\), a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), and the hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)) that separates them. This specific concept is intended to clarify how the existence of \\( x^* \\) ensures that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds.\n\nThe visualization should include a diagram with \\( C \\) represented as a filled shape, \\( x_0 \\) as a distinct point outside this shape, and a dashed line representing the hyperplane. Arrows can be added to indicate the relationships and inequalities between these elements, accompanied by concise labels to make the connections clear. Employing styles like infographics or dynamic diagrams will engage viewers and facilitate a deeper understanding of how separation occurs in various dimensions.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** By using this visualization, learners should gain a concrete understanding of the Separation Theorem and the underlying principles of convex analysis. The focus on cause-and-effect relationships between the components (the set, the point, and the separating hyperplane) will promote critical thinking about dimensionality and the geometric implications of duality. This approach enhances comprehension by emphasizing the dynamic nature of these elements rather than presenting them abstractly.",
