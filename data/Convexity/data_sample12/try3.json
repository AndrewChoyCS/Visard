    "goal": "**Extracted Principle:**\nThe Separation Theorem in convex analysis demonstrates that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and any exterior point \\( x_0 \\), a hyperplane can effectively separate the point \\( x_0 \\) from the set \\( C \\).\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis, highlighting how a hyperplane separates an exterior point \\( x_0 \\) from a closed convex set \\( C \\). The goal is to illustrate the existence of the separating hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)) visually, showing its orientation and relationship to both the point \\( x_0 \\) and the points within the set \\( C \\). This visualization should clarify the concept of separation in various dimensions, emphasizing the underlying geometric relationships between \\( x_0 \\), the hyperplane, and the convex set \\( C \\).\n\nThe visualization should adopt a diagrammatic style, including a 2D graph that shows the convex set \\( C \\) as a shaded area, the exterior point \\( x_0 \\) as a distinct point outside \\( C \\), and the hyperplane represented as a solid line that separates the two. Additional annotations should indicate the functional \\( x^* \\) and the scalar \\( \\delta \\), alongside the inequalities \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) to provide context.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will understand the concept of separation within convex analysis, enabling them to visually appreciate how a hyperplane delineates the boundaries between points inside and outside a closed convex set. By visualizing this principle, learners will be able to grasp the geometric significance of the Separation Theorem and its implications in higher-dimensional spaces. This in-depth understanding will foster the ability to apply these concepts in various mathematical and applied contexts, enhancing their analytical skills in dealing with convex sets.",
