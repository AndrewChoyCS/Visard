    "goal": "**Core Principle: Separation of a Point from a Closed Convex Set Using Hyperplanes**\n\n**Query: Create a visualization to explain the duality theorem in convex analysis, specifically focusing on the separation of a point \\( x_0 \\) that is not in a closed convex set \\( C \\) by a hyperplane (linear functional \\( x^* \\)). The visualization should depict a closed convex set in a two-dimensional plane, with the point \\( x_0 \\) located outside of it. Include the hyperplane that separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\) along with illustrative labels showing the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) for every point \\( x \\) within \\( C \\).**\n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the geometric interpretation of the separation theorem and its application in various dimensional spaces. By visually demonstrating the relationships between the point, the convex set, and the separating hyperplane, learners can gain a clearer understanding of how these elements interact and the significance of the inequalities outlined. \n\n**Visualization Style:** A diagram to be used, showing a two-dimensional view of the closed convex set and the separating hyperplane. Use colors to differentiate between the elements (e.g., a distinct color for the convex set, point, and hyperplane) and arrows to indicate the direction of the separation.\n\n**Key Educational Objectives:**\n- Enhance understanding of the concept of separation in convex analysis, emphasizing why it is a fundamental property.\n- Encourage recognition of the relationships between geometric and analytical representations of convex sets and their separating hyperplanes.\n- Foster critical thinking about how these concepts apply across dimensions, paving the way for deeper explorations in convex optimization and functional analysis.\n\nThis visual will facilitate a deeper understanding of what it means for a functional to separate a point from a convex set, a cornerstone principle in convex analysis.",
