    "data": "A fundamental result in convex analysis known as the duality theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\), if there exists a point \\( x_0 \\) not included in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or a linear functional \\( x^* \\) in the dual space \\( X^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). While it may appear straightforward in two-dimensional space, this principle is valid in any dimensionality, including infinite dimensions. This concept is often termed the geometric version of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which encompasses a variety of related inequalities. Theorem 3.5, recognized as the Separation Theorem, asserts that if \\( C \\subset X \\) is a closed convex set and \\( x_0 \\in X \\setminus C \\), there exists a non-zero functional \\( x^* \\in X^* \\) and a positive scalar \\( \\delta \\) such that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis, specifically focusing on the relationship between a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\). The visualization should depict \\( C \\) in a two-dimensional plane, illustrating the hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)) that separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). Include labeled points, a clear depiction of the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\), and shading to indicate area separation. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the concept of separation in various dimensions while reinforcing the applicability of the theorem beyond simple cases. This diagram should facilitate learners\u2019 understanding of how hyperplanes act to isolate points from convex sets, demonstrating the intuitive yet fundamental relationship between these elements. \n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of the Separation Theorem and its significance in convex analysis, allowing them to apply this principle in higher-dimensional contexts. The visual should effectively communicate cause-effect relationships (how the hyperplane separates \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\)) and provide a sequential pathway to understanding convexity and duality in analysis.",
