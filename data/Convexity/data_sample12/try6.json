    "data": "A fundamental result in convex analysis known as the duality theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\), if there exists a point \\( x_0 \\) not included in \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or a linear functional \\( x^* \\) in the dual space \\( X^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\). While it may appear straightforward in two-dimensional space, this principle is valid in any dimensionality, including infinite dimensions. This concept is often termed the geometric version of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, which encompasses a variety of related inequalities. Theorem 3.5, recognized as the Separation Theorem, asserts that if \\( C \\subset X \\) is a closed convex set and \\( x_0 \\in X \\setminus C \\), there exists a non-zero functional \\( x^* \\in X^* \\) and a positive scalar \\( \\delta \\) such that for every point \\( x \\) in \\( C \\), the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) holds.

    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis.** The goal is to illustrate how a hyperplane or linear functional can separate a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside a closed convex set \\( C \\). This visualization should clarify the relationship between \\( x_0 \\), the convex set \\( C \\), the hyperplane \\( x^* \\), and the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\). \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a diagram that includes a two-dimensional graph with the convex set \\( C \\) shaded, the point \\( x_0 \\) marked outside of \\( C \\), and the separating hyperplane shown clearly with labeled axes. Important notation and inequalities should also be displayed in a clear, legible manner. \n\nThis visual aids in understanding by depicting the spatial relationships and geometric separations inherent in the theorem. By clearly showing how the hyperplane provides a boundary that separates the external point from the convex set, learners will gain a deeper, intuitive grasp of the principle's implications across various dimensions.\n\n**Objective:** By successfully interpreting this visualization, learners will be able to articulate and demonstrate the concept of the Separation Theorem, understanding its significance in convex analysis and applying it to problems involving closed convex sets in multidimensional spaces.",
