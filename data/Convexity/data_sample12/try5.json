    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The Separation Theorem states that for any closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) outside of \\( C \\), there exists a hyperplane (or linear functional \\( x^* \\)) that can separate \\( x_0 \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the Separation Theorem in convex analysis. The goal is to depict how a hyperplane can create a boundary between a closed convex set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x_0 \\) that lies outside of it. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the hyperplane, the point, and the convex set by illustrating the inequality \\( \\langle x^*, x_0 \\rangle + \\delta \\leq \\langle x^*, x \\rangle \\) for any \\( x \\) in \\( C \\). \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a labeled diagram showing a two-dimensional representation of the closed convex set \\( C \\), the point \\( x_0 \\), and the hyperplane \\( x^* \\) as a line that separates them. It should also include arrows or annotations highlighting the inequalities that indicate separation, reinforcing the mathematical relationships visually. \n\nThis approach will deepen the learner\u2019s understanding by providing a clear, intuitive representation of the theorem, making it easier to grasp the concepts of convexity and separation in multiple dimensions.\n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will be able to articulate the Separation Theorem by analyzing relationships between closed convex sets, external points, and hyperplanes in both visual and mathematical contexts, enhancing their understanding of convex analysis principles.",
