    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions through convex combinations.** The goal is to illustrate the condition that for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the domain of a convex function \\( f \\), the line segment connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) must remain above the graph of \\( f \\) itself when evaluating \\( f \\) at points represented by convex combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (i.e., points of the form \\( \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y \\)). \n\nThe visualization should include two plots: one showing the function \\( f \\) and the connecting line segment between \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), and another illustrating a series of convex combinations (for various values of \\( \\lambda \\)) where the function's output is compared with the convex combination of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\). \n\nUsing a diagram or infographic style will effectively highlight the relationships and allow learners to easily see how the conditions of convexity manifest visually. By employing colors or shading to differentiate between the segment and the function, the visual will facilitate a deep understanding of how this specific condition defines convexity, aiding in recognizing the impact of choices of \\( \\lambda \\) on the evaluation of the function. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will understand the core principle of convexity by observing how the geometric representation directly corresponds to the algebraic condition, deepening their grasp of the relationship between points and function values in convex analysis.",
