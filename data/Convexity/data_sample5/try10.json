    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The convexity of a function is defined by the relationship between points in its domain and their corresponding values, specifically that the line segment connecting any two points on the graph does not intersect the graph itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the principle that for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), the value of \\(f\\) at any weighted combination of these points (using \\(\\lambda\\)) must not exceed the weighted combination of their respective function values. The visualization should prominently feature graphs showing a convex function alongside specific points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), highlighting the line segment connecting them, which remains above the graph of \\(f\\). Suggested styles include a clear infographic or diagram that visually compares points on the curve to their linear connections, reinforcing the idea of the convexity condition. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will be able to visually grasp the important relationship between convex combinations of points and their function values, deepening their understanding of the concept of convexity and the conditions that define it. This visualization will aid in identifying key characteristics of convex functions and how they differentiate from concave functions through comparative analysis. \n\n**Objective:** To achieve a comprehensive understanding of convexity by enabling learners to visually and intuitively connect the geometric interpretation of the convexity condition with the mathematical definition, solidifying their grasp of the concept and its implications in function analysis.",
