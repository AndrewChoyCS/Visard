    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle**: The relationship between points on the surface of a convex function and their corresponding linear combinations must maintain a specific inequality, visually represented by the position of a line segment relative to the graph of the function.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity illustrated through the inequality \\( f(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y) \\leq \u03bbf(x) + (1 - \u03bb)f(y) \\). The visualization should depict a graph showing a convex function along with two chosen points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the function's domain, highlighting the line segment connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\). Additionally, indicate the point for any value of \\( \u03bb \\in [0, 1] \\) and demonstrate how it resides above the function\u2019s surface, thus fulfilling the convexity condition. This should include clear annotations and visual distinctions to show relationships between the chosen points, the surface of the function, and the line segment.\n\nThe visualization should utilize a dual-axis graph format, allowing for a clear comparison between the convex function and its linear combinations for various values of \\( \u03bb \\). This approach will help learners intuitively grasp the crucial relationship between the input points, their convex combinations, and the resulting inequality, enhancing their conceptual understanding of convexity. \n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will achieve a deep understanding of the principle of convexity by visually analyzing how the graphical representation of a convex function adheres to the defined inequalities, enabling them to connect abstract mathematical concepts with visual intuition.",
