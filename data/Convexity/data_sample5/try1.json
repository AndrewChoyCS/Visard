    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the relationship between points in the domain of a convex function and how their corresponding function values relate through convex combinations. Specifically, the visualization should depict the condition that ensures a function is convex: that the line segment connecting any two points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) remains above the function\u2019s surface, \\(f\\).\n\nTo clarify this concept effectively, consider using a combination of 2D plots showing the function itself, two chosen points on the curve, and the corresponding line segment connecting them. Include markers for various values of \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g., \\(\\lambda = 0, 0.5, 1\\)) to represent different convex combinations, highlighting how they relate to the values of the function at these points. \n\nBy visualizing these relationships and utilizing clear, labeled diagrams, the viewer will gain a deeper understanding of why convex functions maintain this property and how it connects to the geometric representation of the function. This type of visualization will allow learners to grasp the implications of convexity, enhancing their comprehension of key mathematical concepts in optimization and functional analysis.\n\n**Objective:** To develop a nuanced understanding of convexity by visually demonstrating how weighted combinations of input points and their corresponding outputs maintain a specific geometric relationship, thereby reinforcing the core principle through visual learning.",
