    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The convexity of a function defined on a convex set, characterized by the relationship between points and their function values through convex combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how a function \\( f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) maintains its convexity by showing that the line segment between two points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) lies above or on the graph of the function \\( f \\). This visualization should specifically clarify the relationships between points in the domain, their weighted combinations, and the corresponding function values, emphasizing that the convex combination of function values does not exceed the function value at the convex combination of the input points. \n\nI suggest utilizing a diagram with three main components: a 3D graph of a convex function, two points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) clearly labeled, and the line segment connecting these points. Additionally, show an area where the convex combinations \\( f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\) are located relative to the function surface. This approach will enhance the learner's understanding of the cause-effect relationship inherent in convexity by visually demonstrating how convex combinations behave compared to function evaluations.\n\n**Educational Objective**: By engaging with this visualization, learners will gain a profound understanding of how convex functions are defined and characterized, enabling them to identify convexity in various contexts and apply this knowledge to analyze real-world situations where convexity plays a critical role.",
