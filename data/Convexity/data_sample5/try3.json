    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The visualization should focus on illustrating the definition of convexity in functions, specifically how a convex function keeps the line segment connecting two points on the curve (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) above the graph of the function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on the relationship between points on the function's curve and the line segment connecting them. The goal is to depict how, for any two points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)), the function value at the convex combination of these points (f(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y)) is always less than or equal to the corresponding convex combination of their values (\u03bbf(x) + (1 - \u03bb)f(y)). This visualization should employ a diagram illustrating the curve of a convex function alongside arrows indicating the points and the line segment, clearly labeled to show the inequalities involved. \n\n**Visualization Style:** A diagram that includes a smooth curve representing the convex function, two specific points on the curve, and the connecting line segment. Annotations should highlight the relationships indicated by the inequalities, demonstrating that the segment remains above the curve.\n\n**Educational Outcome:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of the concept of convexity and the geometric interpretation of the definition. This visualization will illuminate the cause-effect relationship between the properties of the function and how convexity is visually represented, thereby reinforcing their comprehension and ability to identify convex functions in various mathematical contexts.",
