    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between convex combinations of points in the domain of a convex function and the corresponding function values, particularly demonstrating that the line segment connecting these points remains above the function's surface.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The visualization should illustrate the core principle that for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the function's domain, the evaluation of the function at any convex combination of these points must not exceed the convex combination of their function values, \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). The goal is to visually represent the line segment connecting \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) and demonstrate how it remains above the surface of the function \\(f\\). Use a 2D graph, depicting the function\u2019s surface along with the points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and clearly label the segments and points, including a graphical representation of various convex combinations (like midpoints). This visual will help learners grasp how convex functions behave in terms of geometric relationships, fostering a deep understanding of the necessary condition for convexity.\n\n**Objective:** To achieve a clear and comprehensive understanding of the properties of convex functions, enabling students to visualize and interpret the geometric significance of convexity, including the implications of the convex combination condition on the behavior of such functions. This understanding is fundamental for applying concepts of convexity in optimization and analysis.",
