    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The evaluation of a convex function must not exceed the convex combination of its values at any two points in its domain, maintaining that the line segment connecting these points stays above the function's surface.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The visualization should depict two points, x and y, on a graph of a convex function f, along with the line segment connecting (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)). It should clearly illustrate that for any point formed by the convex combination, f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y), the function value does not exceed the value of the convex combination, \u03bbf(x) + (1 - \u03bb)f(y). This should include a focus on different values of \u03bb (e.g., \u03bb=0, \u03bb=0.5, \u03bb=1) to show how these locations shift along the line segment without crossing below the function's surface.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a labeled graph with distinct points and line segments, enabling a comparative analysis of the function values and the line segment. By integrating color coding or shading to emphasize the regions above and below the convex function, the visual will clarify the cause-effect relationship between points x, y, and their convex combinations.\n\n**Educational Objectives:** The primary goal is to deepen the learner's understanding of convexity by visually representing how the condition for convex functions holds true across various points. By clearly illustrating these relationships, learners will better grasp how convex combinations relate to the structure of convex functions, fostering an intrinsic comprehension of the foundational properties of convexity in mathematical analysis.",
