    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), and how the value of \\(f\\) at any point along the line segment connecting these two points is constrained by the values of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\).\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to depict how, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the domain, the function values \\(f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y)\\) (where \\(\u03bb\\) varies between 0 and 1) remain below or equal to the linear combination \\(\u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y)\\). The visualization should clearly illustrate the line segment connecting the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\), demonstrating that this segment remains above the function \\(f\\). Utilizing a combination of graphs and diagrams (e.g., 3D plots with shaded areas) will help highlight the cause-effect relationships and the sequential nature of convex combinations, enhancing understanding of this fundamental property in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students will gain a deep understanding of the definition of convexity and its implications, visualize how convex combinations work, and be able to identify the graphical representation of convex functions versus non-convex functions. This visualization will support learners in grasping underlying mathematical relationships intuitively, allowing them to apply these concepts in broader contexts.",
