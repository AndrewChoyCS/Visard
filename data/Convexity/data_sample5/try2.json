    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is termed convex if its domain represents a convex set. For every x and y in its domain, and for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the following must hold: f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) must be less than or equal to \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y). In simpler terms, this means that when choosing two points x and y, if we evaluate f at any point formed by weighting x and y variously (through convex combinations), this value will not exceed the clearly defined convex combination of their respective function values, f(x) and f(y). Visually, it indicates that the line segment that connects (x, f(x)) with (y, f(y)) must remain above the surface of f. If f is a continuous function, checking this condition using \u03bb = 1/2 (or any value between 0 and 1) suffices to confirm convexity. This insight relates closely to previous understandings about midpoint convex sets. Additionally, a function is deemed concave if the negative of it is classified as convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The defining property of a convex function, specifically how the values of a continuous function at convex combinations of inputs must adhere to the convexity condition.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convexity of functions in relation to convex combinations of points. The visualization should depict two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the domain of a convex function \\(f\\), along with the corresponding function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). Highlight the convex combination, \\(f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y)\\), and illustrate the line segment connecting \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\), emphasizing how it remains above the curve of the function \\(f\\). \n\nThe goal is to clarify how the property of convexity ensures that the value of the function at any convex combination of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (for \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\)) does not exceed the linear combination of the function values at \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This visualization could employ a diagrammatic style, integrating color-coded regions to represent the convex set, with annotations that explicitly demonstrate the convexity condition. \n\nBy clearly showing the relationships between input points, their corresponding function values, and the positioning of the function curve relative to the line segment, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the convexity principle and how it affects the behavior of functions. \n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners can articulate the defining characteristics of convex functions and demonstrate their understanding of how the convexity condition inherently shapes the relationships between points and function values within the domain.",
