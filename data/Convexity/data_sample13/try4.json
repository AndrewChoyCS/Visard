    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if, for any interval within its domain, the midpoint value does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. The condition for convexity based on the second derivative states that if \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\) over an interval, then the function is convex.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The goal is to illustrate how a function's value at the midpoint compares to the average of the endpoint values, providing a clear representation of the convexity condition. This visualization should highlight the relationship between the values of the function at specified points and incorporate a graph that shows a function alongside horizontal lines representing the average of the endpoints and the value at the midpoint. Additionally, include another graph depicting the second derivative, indicating regions where \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\) to emphasize its role in establishing convexity. \n\nThis visualization should take the form of an infographic, combining labeled graphs with annotations that clarify how these elements connect to form the definition of convexity. By visually demonstrating the concept and conditions of convexity, the learner will develop a deeper understanding of how convex functions behave and the significance of the second derivative in this context.\n\n**Objective:** The aim is for learners to discern the critical relationship between a function\u2019s geometric properties and its algebraic conditions for convexity, fostering an understanding of how to identify and confirm whether a function is convex using graphical methods and calculus concepts.",
