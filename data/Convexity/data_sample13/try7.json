    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** A function is convex if the midpoint value is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values, and this can be confirmed by the second derivative being non-negative within the interval.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically illustrating how the value at the midpoint of an interval compares to the average of the values at the interval's endpoints. The goal is to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the function's behavior and the condition of the second derivative being non-negative. \n\nThis visualization should include a graph illustrating a convex function, highlighting the specified interval and the midpoint, with arrows or markers showing the comparison of the midpoint value to the average of the endpoints. Additionally, incorporate a section that displays the second derivative, emphasizing that it must be greater than or equal to zero in the same interval. \n\nThrough this visual representation, learners will grasp the key principles of convexity, understand how the second derivative relates to the shape of the function, and contextualize these ideas in terms of practical examples. Using a combination of graphs and labeled diagrams will create a comprehensive instructional tool that clarifies the relationships and reinforces the significant concepts of convexity effectively.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visually identify and understand the essential characteristics of convex functions and the implications of their second derivatives on the shape and properties of the function, leading to a nuanced comprehension of concepts in convexity.",
