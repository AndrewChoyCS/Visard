    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** A function is convex if the value at the midpoint of any interval is less than or equal to the average of the values at the endpoints, with a sufficient condition being that the second derivative is non-negative throughout that interval.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions by illustrating how the midpoint value compares to the average of the endpoint values. The visualization should include a graph of a convex function, marked points for the endpoints, and the midpoint, alongside annotations indicating the average value of the endpoints. This visual will clarify the fundamental property of convex functions and showcase the relationship between the function's geometric representation and its second derivative. Additionally, integrating shaded areas to highlight the differences between the midpoint and the average will help contextualize the condition of non-negativity for the second derivative in a visual manner. \n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of how convexity is defined graphically and the significance of the second derivative, ultimately reinforcing the connection between algebraic properties and geometric interpretations of functions.",
