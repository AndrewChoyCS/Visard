    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The condition for a function to be convex, specifically illustrated by the relationship between the values at the endpoints of an interval and the value at the midpoint.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to clearly illustrate how the value at the midpoint of a function's interval relates to the average of the function's values at the endpoints, highlighting the condition of convexity. A suitable visualization style could be a combination of a graph showcasing a convex function along with marked points for the endpoints and midpoint, alongside a section showing the average line. This visual should also integrate a clear representation of the second derivative, f''(x), demonstrating how the condition of being greater than or equal to zero aligns with the function's convex nature. By visually emphasizing these relationships and comparisons, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how convexity affects function behavior, enhancing their ability to recognize and apply these principles in various contexts.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nTo ensure learners can identify and analyze the conditions that define convexity in functions, facilitating a deep understanding of how the behavior of a function at specific points relates to its overall shape and characteristics.",
