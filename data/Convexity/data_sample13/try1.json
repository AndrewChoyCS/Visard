    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** A function is convex if the value at the midpoint of any interval does not exceed the average of the function\u2019s values at the endpoints, which is confirmed by the non-negativity of the second derivative across the interval.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, highlighting the relationship between the graphical representation of a convex function and its mathematical properties. The goal is to depict how, for any interval within the function's domain, the value at the midpoint remains less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. The visualization should include a graph of a convex function with clearly labeled points showing the endpoints and midpoint, along with arrows or annotations illustrating the average. Additionally, incorporate a separate graph showing the second derivative, emphasizing that it is greater than or equal to zero throughout the interval. This dual representation facilitates a deeper understanding of how the second derivative condition correlates with the geometric property of being convex.\n\n**Visualization Style Suggestions:** Use a combined infographic and graph with labeled axes, clear color coding for the various elements, and arrows to indicate key relationships. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will understand the graphical characteristics of convex functions, comprehend how the second derivative serves as a test for convexity, and gain insights into the cause-and-effect relationship between algebraic properties and geometric shapes in function analysis. The visualization will help reinforce the conceptual hierarchy of properties that define convexity in a clear and engaging manner. \n\n**Objective:** Ensure that learners can accurately determine if a function is convex by visually identifying key features within the graph and understanding the underlying mathematical principles represented by the second derivative. This will solidify their comprehension of convexity and its implications in various mathematical contexts.",
