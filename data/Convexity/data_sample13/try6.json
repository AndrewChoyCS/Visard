    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if the value at the midpoint of any interval within its domain does not exceed the average of the function's values at the endpoints, and this can be verified using its second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly focusing on the midpoint condition and the role of the second derivative in determining convexity. The goal is to visually represent a graph of a convex function that illustrates the relationship between a point at the midpoint and the average of the endpoint values, while also depicting the second derivative remaining non-negative throughout the interval. This visualization should help clarify the core concept of convexity by using a line graph that includes labeled points, shaded areas for averages, and annotations for the second derivative. Suggested styles include an infographic or a diagram that highlights these relationships, showing how the midpoint's value relates to the endpoints and how the second derivative's characteristics confirm convexity. \n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will be able to deeply understand and identify the properties of convex functions, recognize how the midpoint condition is applied, and comprehend the significance of the second derivative in verifying convexity, thereby fostering a foundational understanding of convexity in calculus.",
