    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition of a convex function, particularly the relationship between the function's values at the endpoints and the midpoint, and the implications of the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the principle of convexity in functions. The goal is to visually demonstrate how, for any interval within a function's domain, the value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. This visualization should include a graph that plots a sample convex function, highlights the endpoints and their average, and marks the midpoint, illustrating the relationship clearly. Additionally, incorporate a side chart that depicts the second derivative \\( f''(x) \\), showing it as non-negative across the interval [a,b]. This will clarify the concept of convexity by showcasing the cause-effect relationship between the function's curvature and the condition of the second derivative. \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a deep understanding of how the graphical representation of convexity aligns with mathematical definitions, as well as insight into the practical implications of a non-negative second derivative in determining convex behavior. Suggested visualization styles could include a clear graph combined with annotated points and a secondary line plot for the second derivative, aiding in the sequential understanding of these mathematical relationships. \n\n**Objective:** Students will demonstrate a crucial understanding of convex functions by visually relating the characteristics of midpoint assessments to endpoint averages and the implications of the second derivative, thereby reinforcing their comprehension of function behavior in calculus.",
