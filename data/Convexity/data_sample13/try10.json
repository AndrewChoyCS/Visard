    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between the midpoint value of a function and the average of its endpoint values as a condition for convexity, along with the significance of the second derivative being non-negative.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on how the value at the midpoint of a function compares to the average of its values at the endpoints. The goal is to visually represent the condition that defines a convex function, particularly illustrating how the second derivative being non-negative contributes to this property. The visualization should include a graph where the function is plotted alongside lines connecting the endpoints and the midpoint, clearly displaying the average of the endpoints. Additionally, incorporate a secondary graph to show the second derivative and its non-negativity. This will help learners understand how these concepts are interrelated, emphasizing cause-effect relationships and the threshold requirements for a function to be classified as convex. \n\nThe visualization style should be a dual graph representation with labels and clear distinctions between the function, average, and second derivative, enhancing clarity and establishing connections between these mathematical relationships.\n\n**Educational Objective**: By the end of this visualization, learners will be able to explain the concept of convexity in functions, recognize the significance of the midpoint value in relation to the endpoints, and articulate the role of the second derivative in determining convexity.",
