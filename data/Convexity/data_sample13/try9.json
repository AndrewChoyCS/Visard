    "data": "A function is considered convex if, for any interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not surpass the average of the function's values at the endpoints. If f(x) possesses a second derivative in the interval [a,b], then a complete and sufficient condition for this function to be convex on that interval is that its second derivative, denoted f''(x), is greater than or equal to zero for every x within [a,b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if the value at any midpoint within an interval does not exceed the average of the function's values at the endpoints, with the condition that its second derivative is non-negative in that interval.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on the relationship between the midpoint value and the average of the endpoint values. The visualization should illustrate a specific interval [a, b] on a graph where a convex function is plotted, highlighting the midpoint M and the values f(a), f(b), and their average. Use a clear diagram to show how the midpoint value compares to the average, and integrate an inset graph displaying the second derivative f''(x) to visually depict its non-negativity across the interval. By employing contrasting colors and annotations, this visual will clarify how the relationship between the midpoint and the endpoints supports the definition of convexity, reinforcing key educational outcomes such as understanding how curvature relates to derivative behavior and recognizing visualization as a tool for grasping mathematical concepts.\n\n**Objective:** Students will gain a deep understanding of convexity in functions by visually representing how midpoint values interact with endpoint averages and how the second derivative's behavior confirms this relationship, enabling them to identify convex functions and appreciate the significance of derivatives in characterizing function properties.",
