    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe definition of a convex function, characterized by the condition that the function\u2019s value at the midpoint of an interval does not exceed the average of its endpoint values, and the relationship with the non-negativity of the second derivative.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to depict how the value of a convex function at the midpoint of any interval compares to the average of its endpoint values, while also illustrating the role of the second derivative in confirming convexity. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the geometric interpretation of convexity and the analytical criterion of the second derivative being non-negative. \n\nInclude a clear graph showing a convex function, marking points at the endpoints and the midpoint, with lines indicating the average value at the endpoints. Additionally, incorporate a secondary graph that visually represents the second derivative, highlighting areas of non-negativity. The visualization should utilize an infographic style to ensure clarity and engagement, helping learners visualize both the geometric and analytical aspects of convexity.\n\n**Learning Objective:** \nStudents will be able to demonstrate a deep understanding of convexity by clearly articulating how the geometric properties of functions are directly related to their second derivatives, ultimately enabling them to apply these concepts to identify and analyze convex functions in various contexts.",
