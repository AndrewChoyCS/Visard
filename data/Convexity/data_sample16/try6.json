    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: A function is convex if the value at the midpoint of any interval does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints, and a function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative in the interval.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity of functions through graphical representation. The goal is to illustrate how the values of a convex function at the midpoint compare to the average of the values at the endpoints using a graph. This should include an illustrative graph of a convex function and a corresponding labeled diagram showing the endpoints and midpoint, clearly indicating the average point. Additionally, overlay the graph with a depiction of the second derivative, showcasing regions where it remains non-negative. \n\nThe visualization should facilitate a clear understanding of how the convexity condition is visually manifested and represented mathematically, emphasizing cause-effect relationships between the behavior of the function and its second derivative. Incorporating infographic elements to emphasize key points and using color coding to differentiate between convex and non-convex areas will enhance comprehension. \n\n**Objective**: By the end of this visualization, learners will deeply understand the characteristics of convex functions, how they can identify convexity through graphical means, and the relationship between a function's curvature and its second derivative, leading to stronger intuition for analyzing and drawing conclusions about mathematical functions in a visual context.",
