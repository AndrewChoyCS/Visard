    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if its midpoint value is less than or equal to the average of its endpoint values, which can be confirmed by a non-negative second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing specifically on how the values at the midpoint compare to the average values of the endpoints. The visualization should include a graph that plots a convex function, clearly marking the endpoints and the midpoint, along with lines that illustrate the average of the values at the endpoints. Additionally, include a separate section that displays the second derivative, highlighting the non-negativity condition across the interval to depict its relationship with the convexity of the function. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify how convexity is established both geometrically (through the comparison of values) and analytically (through the second derivative). Specifically, it should aid students in understanding the cause-effect relationship between the properties of a convex function and its mathematical representation. \n\nAn infographic style would be effective here, combining graphical elements with concise labels for clarity. This visual will not only reinforce the concept of convexity but also illustrate how the second derivative relates to function behavior, ultimately enhancing students\u2019 comprehension of these foundational principles in calculus.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to identify and analyze the conditions for convexity in functions by interpreting graphical representations and understanding the relationship between midpoint values, endpoint averages, and the second derivative.",
