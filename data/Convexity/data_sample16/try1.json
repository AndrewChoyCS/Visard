    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if its value at the midpoint of an interval does not exceed the average value of the endpoints, and this can be verified by the non-negativity of its second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should clearly depict the relationship between a function's values at the endpoints and its midpoint, illustrating how the condition for convexity is satisfied. This can be achieved by using a graph that plots the function alongside a visual indication of the average of the endpoint values and the value at the midpoint. Additionally, incorporate a separate graph showing the second derivative, highlighting where it remains non-negative over the specified interval. \n\nThe goal is to clarify how these characteristics define convexity and the importance of the second derivative in confirming this property. By using line graphs, annotated points, and shaded areas to represent averages, learners will visualize the cause-and-effect relationship between the curvature of the function and the mathematical criterion for convexity. \n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:** Upon completing the visualization, learners will be able to articulate the definition of convexity, understand how to visually confirm this property using a function's graph, and recognize the significance of the second derivative in identifying convex functions. This objective focuses on fostering a deep understanding of the concept, enabling learners to connect graphical representations with mathematical definitions effectively.",
