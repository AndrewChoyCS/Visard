    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if, for every interval within its domain, the value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints, with the criterion for convexity further supported by the non-negativity of the second derivative over a specified interval.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, focusing on how the values at specific points relate to the midpoint and the implications of the second derivative being non-negative. The visualization should depict a graph of a convex function with clearly marked endpoints and a midpoint, illustrating how the value at the midpoint compares to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, include a side panel that shows the corresponding second derivative graph, highlighting where the values are non-negative across the interval. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the function's shape and convexity criteria, reinforcing the understanding that if a function's second derivative is non-negative, it supports the convexity condition. This visualization should be designed as an infographic, integrating graphs with annotations that explain the significance of each component. It will help learners grasp the cause-effect relationship inherent in the definition of convexity, enabling them to intuitively understand how the function and its derivatives interact to determine convexity.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will understand and visualize how the convexity of a function is defined through the comparison of midpoint values and the importance of the second derivative, fostering a deeper insight into the characteristics that classify functions as convex.",
