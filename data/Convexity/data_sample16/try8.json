    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition of a convex function, focusing on the relationship between function values at the endpoints and the midpoint, as well as the role of the second derivative in establishing convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of a convex function. The aim is to illustrate how the value of a convex function at the midpoint of an interval is always less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, show the relationship between the second derivative and convexity, highlighting that a non-negative second derivative indicates the function is convex. This visualization should include graphs depicting different convex functions, with marked points for the endpoints and midpoint, as well as a visual representation of the second derivative, such as a graph that corresponds to the convexity condition. \n\nIntegrating styles like diagrams and annotated graphs will foster deeper comprehension by illustrating cause-and-effect relationships between the function shape, the midpoint condition, and second derivative behavior. The expected educational outcome is for learners to clearly understand the defining characteristics of convexity, recognize the graphical representation of these properties, and appreciate how they relate mathematically. \n\n**Objective:** Achieve a thorough understanding of the definition and graphical characteristics of convex functions through visual representation, enabling students to apply this knowledge in recognizing and analyzing convexity within various mathematical contexts.",
