    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition and criteria of convex functions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions. The goal is to illustrate how, for any interval within a function's domain, the function's value at the midpoint corresponds to the average of the values at the endpoints, thereby demonstrating the convex nature. Additionally, the visualization should show the relationship between the second derivative and convexity, indicating that if the second derivative remains non-negative over an interval, the function is convex within that range. \n\nTo accomplish this, consider designing a multi-part diagram that presents a graph of a convex function with clearly marked intervals and midpoints, along with a secondary graph illustrating the second derivative, highlighting areas where it is non-negative. This will visually depict the relationship between the function's curvature (convexity) and the behavior of its second derivative. By using color coding and annotations to guide interpretation, the visualization will emphasize cause-effect relationships and make the concept of convexity more accessible.\n\n**Learning Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners should be able to clearly identify the characteristics of convex functions, understand how they relate to their second derivatives, and apply these criteria to analyze and determine the convexity of various mathematical functions.",
