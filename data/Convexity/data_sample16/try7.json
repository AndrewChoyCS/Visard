    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if the value at the midpoint of any interval does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints, and this is confirmed by the non-negativity of the second derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to illustrate how the values of a convex function at the midpoint and endpoints relate to each other and how the non-negativity of the second derivative correlates with this property. The visualization should include a graph of a convex function, marked points for the endpoints and midpoint, and visual representations (arrows or shaded areas) demonstrating that the function value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the average of the endpoint values. Additionally, include a secondary plot showing the second derivative and highlighting where it remains non-negative.\n\nThis visualization should take the form of a combination of graphs and annotations, allowing for a comparative analysis between the convex function and its second derivative. By clearly illustrating these relationships, learners can better grasp the critical concept of convexity and its mathematical underpinnings, reinforcing an understanding of how geometrical representations can inform function behavior.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to understand and articulate the definition of convexity in functions, identify the relationship between the values at the midpoint and endpoints, and demonstrate knowledge of how the second derivative's behavior confirms convexity, enabling deeper insights into function analysis.",
