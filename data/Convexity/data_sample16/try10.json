    "data": "A function is defined as convex if, for every interval within its domain, the function's value at the midpoint does not exceed the average of the values at the endpoints. If a function f(x) has a second derivative that is continuous over the interval [a, b], then the criterion for its convexity in that section is met if the second derivative f''(x) remains non-negative for all x in the range [a, b].",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nA function is considered convex when its value at any midpoint does not exceed the average of its values at the interval endpoints, with the second derivative being non-negative throughout the interval.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions through graphical representation. The goal is to illustrate how a convex function behaves across an interval, specifically showing the relationship between the values at the endpoints and the midpoint. Incorporate two graphs: one displaying a convex function with plotted points at the endpoints and midpoint, and another illustrating the behavior of the second derivative, indicating regions where it is non-negative. \n\nThis visualization should utilize line graphs and highlighted areas to clearly show the convex region, helping learners see the relationship between the function's shape and its second derivative. By emphasizing these relationships, the visual will facilitate a deeper understanding of how and why functions are classified as convex, aligning with the educational outcome of recognizing the mathematical properties that define convexity through their graphical representations.\n\n### Objective:\nStudents should be able to visually identify and describe the characteristics of convex functions, including how the values at midpoints relate to endpoint averages and the significance of non-negative second derivatives in determining convexity. This understanding will ground their conceptual knowledge and application of convexity in mathematical analysis.",
