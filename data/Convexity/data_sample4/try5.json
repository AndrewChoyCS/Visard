    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The concept of convex sets and the relationship between a function's graph and its epigraph.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity through the relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function. The goal is to clearly illustrate how any line segment connecting two points within a convex set remains entirely within that set, and how this relates to the epigraph of a convex function, which lies above the function\u2019s graph. \n\nThe visualization should include diagrams comparing convex and non-convex shapes, alongside a graph of a convex function with its epigraph highlighted. Use color coding to differentiate between the function graph and its epigraph, and visually demonstrate line segments that illustrate the concept of remaining above the graph. \n\nBy focusing on the relationships between these elements, the visual will aid learners in deeply understanding how convexity establishes a foundational property of functions that affects their behavior and characteristics. Key educational outcomes include recognizing the definition of convexity in sets and functions, and understanding the significance of epigraphs in visualizing these mathematical concepts. \n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of convex sets and functions, enabling them to recognize and analyze convexity in mathematical contexts, both visually and theoretically.",
