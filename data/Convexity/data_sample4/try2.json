    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe concept of convex functions and their associated epigraphs, where any line segment connecting two points in a convex set remains entirely within that set.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and convex functions through their epigraphs. The goal is to depict how the epigraph of a function illustrates the definition of a convex function, highlighting that every line segment connecting points above the graph remains above the function itself. This visualization should clearly show the geometric representation of a convex set and its epigraph in relation to a specific function graph. \n\nThe specific aspect of the principle to be visualized is the relationship between the line segments and the graph of the function. Suggested visualization styles may include a graph with highlighted convex regions, line segments connecting points above the function, and labels to clarify terms such as \"convex set\" and \"epigraph.\" This visual aid will deepen understanding by illustrating the fundamental property of convexity in a tangible way, allowing learners to visualize the conditions that define convex functions and their epigraphs.\n\n### Objective:\nStudents will be able to identify and analyze the characteristics of convex functions by interpreting the graphical relationship between a function's epigraph and its convex set, enabling a clear understanding of why convexity is important in mathematical analysis and optimization.",
