    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between convex sets, epigraphs, and convex functions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept that convex sets allow for line segments connecting any two points within them to reside entirely within the set, and how this applies to the epigraph of a function representing a convex function. The goal is to illustrate the shape of a convex set alongside the epigraph of the function, clearly showing that the area above the function represents all the points in the epigraph. Additionally, highlight the feature that any line segment drawn between two points in the epigraph remains above the function graph, reinforcing the definition of a convex function. \n\nUsing styles such as layered diagrams or overlaid graphs, integrate visual representations of a convex set, the graph of a function, and its epigraph. This will not only clarify the relationships between these elements but also highlight the properties of convexity in an engaging and intuitive manner. By employing color coding and clear labeling, the visualization will enhance understanding and retention of the concept.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to identify and differentiate between convex sets, epigraphs, and convex functions by analyzing their visual representations, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of convexity in mathematical functions.",
