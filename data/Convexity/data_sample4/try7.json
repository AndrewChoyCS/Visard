    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\n**Convex Sets and Convex Functions:** A convex set is defined as a shape where any line segment connecting two points within the set remains entirely within that set. For a function, it is considered convex if its epigraph (the area above or on its graph) forms a convex set.\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions.** The visualization should include two graphs: one illustrating a convex set with line segments connecting two points within the set, demonstrating that these segments remain inside the shape. The second graph should depict the epigraph of a convex function f, highlighting how all line segments drawn above the curve remain at or above the function graph. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the relationship between convex sets and convex functions, reinforcing the definition of both concepts through interactive illustration. Key educational outcomes include the ability to identify convex sets and understand how the epigraph relates to the convexity of functions.\n\nThis visualization should utilize a clean diagrammatic style, integrating color coding to distinguish between parts of the convex set and the function graph, as well as annotations that explain the relationship between them. By visually representing these concepts, learners will grasp the inherent properties of convexity, helping deepen their understanding through visual engagement with the definitions and relationships involved. \n\n### Learning Objective:\nStudents will be able to articulate and visually identify the characteristics of convex sets and functions, recognizing the significance of the epigraph in establishing a function's convexity, thereby connecting geometric intuition to algebraic properties.",
