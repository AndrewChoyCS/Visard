    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between convex sets and convex functions through the visualization of epigraphs.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions through the representation of an epigraph. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how a convex set is defined by the property that any line segment connecting two points within the set remains entirely within the set. Additionally, it should demonstrate how the epigraph of a function f consists of all points lying on or above its graph, emphasizing that for a function to be convex, its epigraph must also be a convex set. \n\nThe visualization should use a combination of graphs and shaded areas to depict the graphs of a convex function and its corresponding epigraph, clearly labeling the line segments and points to highlight the relationships between these elements. By providing visual clarity, the learning outcome will facilitate a deep understanding of how convexity is determined and recognized in both geometric and functional terms. \n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a thorough understanding of how the characteristics of convex sets and functions intersect, enabling them to recognize and apply the concept of convexity in various mathematical contexts.",
