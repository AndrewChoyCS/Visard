    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\nThe concept of a **convex function** and its epigraph, specifically illustrating how every line segment drawn between any two points on the epigraph lies above or on the graph of the function.\n\n### Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and their epigraphs.** The goal is to visually illustrate how a convex function's epigraph comprises points that are always on or above the function's graph, highlighting that any line segment connecting two points on the epigraph remains above the graph itself. This visualization should utilize a combination of a graph depicting a convex function alongside shaded areas representing the epigraph and appropriate line segments. By clearly labeling the curves, segments, and shaded regions, the visualization aims to deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of the relationship between convex sets and convex functions, emphasizing the essential property of a convex epigraph in a way that is intuitive and engaging.\n\n### Educational Outcomes:\n1. Learners will understand the definition and traits of convex sets and convex functions.\n2. Students will develop the ability to recognize and visualize the graphical properties of convex functions and their epigraphs.\n3. The visualization will clarify the cause-effect relationship between the shape of the graph and the properties of convexity, enabling learners to predict outcomes based on graphical observations. \n\n### Objective:\nStudents will develop a profound understanding of convex functions by interpreting and analyzing the properties of their epigraphs through dynamic visual representations, ensuring they can apply this knowledge in various mathematical and real-world contexts.",
