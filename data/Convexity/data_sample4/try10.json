An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set.

    "goal": "**Core Principle: The definition and properties of convex sets and convex functions as visualized in their graphical representation.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions using graphical representations. The goal is to illustrate a convex set as a shape where any line segment between two points remains within the set, alongside a graph of a function that depicts its epigraph. The visualization should clearly show how a function is convex if its epigraph\u2014consisting of points above or on the graph\u2014forms a convex set. Highlight the relationships between the graph of the function and its epigraph, demonstrating that all line segments between points in the epigraph lie on or above the function graph. \n\nUtilize a combination of diagrams and interactive elements to engage learners. For instance, include shaded areas for the convex set, drawn lines to illustrate the relationship of points within the set, and color-coded segments to differentiate between the epigraph and the function. This will deepen understanding of how convexity operates in mathematical contexts by providing a clear and visual explanation of the properties and implications of convex functions.\n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:**\nBy using this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of the properties of convex sets and functions, recognize their significance in mathematical analysis, and be able to identify convexity in graphical representations effectively.",
