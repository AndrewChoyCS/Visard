    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between convex sets and convex functions, particularly how the epigraph of a function illustrates the properties of convexity.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions through the depiction of their characteristics and relationships. The goal is to visually represent a standard convex set alongside an example of a convex function\u2019s graph, including its epigraph\u2014the area above the graph. This visualization should clearly show how any line segment connecting two points within the convex set remains entirely within it, and illustrate how the epigraph confirms the function's convexity by remaining above the graph of the function. \n\nBy employing a clear diagram that includes an annotated convex set, the function's graph, and the epigraph, this visualization will enhance learner understanding by highlighting the key concept that every line segment on the graph of a convex function lies on or above the function. This approach fosters comparative analysis and relationships between the shape of the convex set, the graph, and its epigraph, ultimately reinforcing the principle of convexity.\n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners grasp the essence of convexity, illustrating how the properties of convex sets and functions interconnect, thereby allowing for a deeper comprehension of their mathematical implications and applications in various contexts.",
