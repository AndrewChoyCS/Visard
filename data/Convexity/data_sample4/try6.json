    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe concept of a convex set and its relationship to the epigraph of a function, emphasizing that a function is convex if its epigraph is a convex set.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and convex functions through their epigraphs. The goal is to clearly illustrate how a convex set is defined by the property that line segments joining any two points within the set remain contained in the set. Additionally, depict the epigraph of a function graph, highlighting how the convexity of the function relates to the shape of its epigraph. This visualization could include diagrams comparing convex and non-convex sets, as well as showing various function graphs alongside their respective epigraphs. \n\nBy integrating these elements, the visualization will not only clarify the definition and properties of convexity but will also illuminate the logical relationship between function graphs and their epigraphs. This is expected to enhance the learner\u2019s understanding of how convexity manifests in graphical forms and the implications for functions.\n\n**Objective:**\nDeeply understand the characteristics of convex sets and functions, specifically how the definition of a convex function is represented visually and how this relates to the concept of the epigraph, ultimately enabling learners to recognize these properties in various mathematical contexts.",
