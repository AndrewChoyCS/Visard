    "data": "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set. This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. ",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:**\nThe relationship between convex sets and the associated epigraph of a convex function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and the structure of the epigraph of a convex function. The goal is to illustrate how a convex set is formed, emphasizing that any line segment connecting two points within the set remains entirely within the shape. Additionally, the visualization should depict a function's epigraph, clearly showing that all points in this epigraph lie on or above the function's graph, highlighting the relationship between the convexity of the function and its epigraph. \n\nRecommended styles include a combination of a diagram illustrating convex sets with annotated curves and points, and a graph depicting a convex function with its epigraph distinctly marked. This approach will help learners visually relate the definitions and characteristics of convex sets and functions, deepening their understanding of the inherent relationships between these concepts. By specifically illustrating the principles of convexity, the visual will foster a better grasp of why convex functions maintain certain properties, such as ensuring that line segments remain above the function's graph.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will be able to clearly differentiate between convex sets and non-convex sets, identify the properties of an epigraph, and articulate why a function\u2019s convexity is significant in terms of optimization and analysis.",
