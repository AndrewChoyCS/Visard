    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between points on a convex function, specifically how the line segment joining two points lies above the curve of the function, illustrating the definition of convexity.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The goal is to visually represent how, for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) on the function curve, the straight line connecting \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) lies above the curve itself, demonstrating that \\( f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) \\). This visualization should clarify the implications of convexity in a geometric context, highlighting the relationship between the function's graphical representation and its mathematical conditions.\n\n**Visualization Style:** An infographic or diagram that includes a detailed plot of a convex function with clearly labeled axes, marked points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and the connecting line segment. The curve must be highlighted in contrast to this segment to show the inequality visually.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students should be able to intuitively understand that convex functions fulfill the condition of lying beneath the straight line between any two points, reinforcing the mathematical definition of convexity. This visual aid will enhance comprehension by showing the relationship between geometric shapes and their algebraic properties, thus deepening students' understanding of mathematical functions and their characteristics in real-world applications.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visual representation, learners should be able to articulate and demonstrate the properties of convex functions and apply this knowledge to identify convexity in various functions encountered in mathematics and related fields.",
