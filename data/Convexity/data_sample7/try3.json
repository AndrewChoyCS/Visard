    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The condition for a function to be convex, specifically the relationship between selected points and their function values at convex combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the convexity of a function through the relationship between points in its domain and their corresponding function values. The goal is to visually demonstrate that for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the convex domain, the function value at any weighted average of these points (using \\(\u03bb\\)), cannot exceed the weighted average of their function values \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\). This should illustrate both the geometric concept where the straight line connecting \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) lies above the curve \\(f\\) and also highlight the verification process using a specific value of \\(\u03bb\\) (like \\(1/2\\)).\n\nThe visualization should incorporate diagrams that show a curve representing the function, a line segment connecting the points, and shaded areas to help illustrate the relationship intuitively. By visually dividing the domain and function values, it will clarify how convex combinations work, thereby deepening the understanding of convexity versus concavity. This approach aids students in grasping foundational concepts of convexity, enriching their comprehension through comparative analysis and context.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will demonstrate a deep understanding of the principle of convexity by identifying and illustrating the geometric relationships that define convex functions, thereby enhancing their ability to analyze and interpret mathematical functions in real-world scenarios.",
