    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The geometric interpretation of convexity, specifically how the function value at any convex combination of two points is less than or equal to the line connecting the function values at those points.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the geometric interpretation of convexity in functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how, for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within a convex function's domain, the line segment connecting the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\) lies above the curve of the function \\(f\\). This visual will clarify the relationship between the convex combination of the points and the corresponding function values, facilitating understanding of the concept of convexity. \n\nThe visualization should incorporate a graph with the curve of a convex function, highlighted line segments between selected points, and the resulting convex combinations expressed on the graph. A useful style could be a detailed infographic that integrates labeled segments, shaded regions representing the convex combinations, and visual indicators for the function values. By emphasizing the relationships between the straight line and the curve, this visual will deepen comprehension of how convexity operates and the implications for function behavior.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to accurately describe convexity in functions by using geometric interpretations and demonstrate their understanding through graphical analysis, recognizing the significance of the property where the function's value at a convex combination never exceeds the corresponding linear combination of function values.",
