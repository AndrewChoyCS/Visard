    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The relationship between points on a convex function and their convex combinations, emphasizing that the function value at any convex combination is less than or equal to the convex combination of the function values at those points.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the convexity of functions in relation to their geometric representation. The goal is to illustrate how for any two points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the function's domain, the function value at any convex combination \\(f(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y)\\) remains below the straight line connecting the points \\((x, f(x))\\) and \\((y, f(y))\\). This will clarify the concept of convexity by explicitly showing how the locus of points on the curve lies below the linear connection between those two function values. \n\nThe visualization should consist of a graph that exhibits both the curve of the convex function and the line segment between the two points, as well as several marked \\(\u03bb\\) values to denote different convex combinations. An infographic style can be used to make the distinction between the function's lower region and the line segment clear and engaging.\n\nBy incorporating labeled points and contextual explanations, this visualization will enhance the learners' understanding of the fundamental relationship between the linear and nonlinear components of convexity. **Educational Outcome:** Students will achieve a deep and clear understanding of convex functions and their properties, recognizing how graphical interpretations reflect mathematical definitions.",
