    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition and geometric interpretation of convex functions, particularly the relationship between points in the domain and the corresponding function values.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, specifically illustrating the relationship between two points in the domain x and y, their corresponding function values f(x) and f(y), and the requirement that the straight line connecting (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) lies above the curve of the function f. The goal is to clarify how convex combinations of points must adhere to the convexity condition, emphasizing the role of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1]. The visualization should consist of a graph displaying the curve of a convex function alongside the points (x, f(x)), (y, f(y)), and the midpoint (\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y, f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y)), clearly labeled to show relationships. \n\nThis visual can utilize a diagram with labeled segments illustrating the linear interpolation, thereby highlighting the concept of convexity against a backdrop of comparative function values. The expected educational outcome is a deep understanding of how convexity enforces specific relationships between function values when calculated from linear combinations of points, enhancing the student\u2019s grasp of geometric properties inherent to convex functions.\n\n**Objective:** To facilitate a deep understanding of how the condition for convexity shapes the relationship between points and their respective function values, reinforcing the concept through visual representation of their geometric interactions.",
