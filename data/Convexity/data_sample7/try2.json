    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function is convex if the value at any convex combination of two points within its domain is less than or equal to the convex combination of their function values.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions, particularly how the function value at a convex combination of two points relates to the convex combination of their function values. The visualization should illustrate a graph with a convex function, highlighting two arbitrary points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the corresponding points \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(y)\\), and the straight line connecting these two points. Additionally, depict a convex combination point, using a specific value of \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g., 1/2), to show that the function value at that point lies below the connecting line. \n\nThis visual representation should include clear labels for the function, points, and line, allowing learners to grasp the relationship between the points and the concept of convexity intuitively. By using a graph format, the visualization will clarify sequential relationships and cause-effect dynamics, ensuring a deep understanding of how convexity manifests in mathematical functions.\n\n**Objective:** To provide learners with a robust understanding of convexity by illustrating how the comparative relationship between points and their function values confirms the convex property, thus enhancing their ability to identify and analyze convex functions in various mathematical contexts.",
