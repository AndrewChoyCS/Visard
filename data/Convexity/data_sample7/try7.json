    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The defining property of a convex function involves the comparison of function values at convex combinations of points and the geometric interpretation of these points and values within the function's domain.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in mathematical functions, emphasizing the relationship between two points on the function curve and their convex combination. The goal is to visually depict how the function value at the convex combination (i.e., a point between the two selected points) is always less than or equal to the straight line connecting the values of those two points on the curve. This visualization should use stacked graphs to illustrate multiple scenarios of convex combinations for various values of \u03bb, while highlighting how the straight line connects points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)). \n\nBy representing this concept through a clear diagram or infographic, learners will be able to intuitively grasp the principle of convexity, understand the significance of the chosen \u03bb values, and see how these relationships manifest geometrically. The visual should also include annotations explaining the mathematical inequalities involved and the implications for continuity. This approach will deepen understanding of convexity by illustrating the underlying geometric principles and cause-effect relationships intrinsic to the concept.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will demonstrate a deep understanding of convex functions by analyzing how the graphical representation of these functions and their characteristics can help predict behavior and make mathematical judgments about convex combinations within function domains.",
