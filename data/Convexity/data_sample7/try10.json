    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The condition for a function \\( f \\) to be convex, specifically the relationship expressed by \\( f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda)f(y) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the convexity of a function by illustrating the inequality \\( f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda)f(y) \\). The goal is to visually demonstrate how any convex combination of two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within the domain results in a function value that does not exceed the convex combination of their corresponding function values. This can be achieved by plotting the function \\( f(x) \\) alongside the straight line connecting the points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\) for a range of values of \\( \\lambda \\), particularly focusing on \\( \\lambda = 0.5 \\). \n\nThe visualization should be a combination of a graph demonstrating the function curve, the points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and the line segment connecting them, clearly indicating the region that represents the convexity condition. Labels and annotations should emphasize the relationships between the points and the convex combination line, facilitating a comparative analysis of the depicted values. \n\nThe visual aids will enhance understanding by making the mathematical concepts relatable and emphasizing cause-effect relationships inherent in convex functions, thereby fostering a deep, conceptual grasp of convexity and providing clarity on how specific values of \\( \\lambda \\) impact this relationship. \n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a fundamental understanding of the convexity condition by visually engaging with the relationships in the function, improving their ability to identify convex functions and apply these concepts in mathematical scenarios.",
