    "data": "A function f : R n \u2192 R is said to be convex if it has a domain that is a convex set. For every pair of points x and y within its domain, and for any value of \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], the condition f(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(y) must hold. This means that when we select any two points x and y, the function value at any convex combination of these points is not greater than the convex combination of their function values, f(x) and f(y). In geometric terms, the straight line connecting the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) must lie above the curve described by f. If f is continuous, it suffices to verify convexity using a fixed value of \u03bb, such as 1/2 (or any \u03bb within (0, 1)). This resembles checks related to midpoint convex sets previously discussed. Additionally, we consider a function concave if the function -f is convex.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The relationship between points on a convex function and the requirement that the line segment joining the points (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) lies above the curve defined by the function f.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions. The visualization should illustrate how for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within a convex function, the function value at any convex combination \\( \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y \\) does not exceed the convex combination of their respective function values \\( \u03bbf(x) + (1 - \u03bb)f(y) \\). To achieve this, the visual should depict a curve representing a convex function, the corresponding points \\( (x, f(x)) \\) and \\( (y, f(y)) \\), and the line segment connecting these points, clearly showing that the line lies above the function curve. \n\nThis could be done in a diagram format that emphasizes the geometric relationship, highlighting the key inequality visually. Integrating colors and annotations can help clarify the concept of convex combinations. By visualizing the relationship between points, lines, and the function curve, the learner will better grasp the definition and properties of convexity. \n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of convexity by visualizing the essential relationship between the function values and their geometric representation, allowing them to visualize and internalize why convex functions exhibit the specified properties and how this relates to midpoint convex sets.",
