    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted\nThe core principle is the relationship between convex sets and their epigraphs, emphasizing that a function \\( f \\) is convex if its epigraph, comprising points on or above the graph, forms a convex set.\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their epigraphs in the context of convex functions.** The visualization should effectively illustrate how any straight line drawn between two points within a convex set remains entirely within that set. Additionally, it should depict the graph of a convex function \\( f \\) along with its epigraph, highlighting that all points in the epigraph are located on or above the function's curve. Use a combination of labeled diagrams showing both a convex set and the epigraph of a function to reinforce understanding. \n\nThe key educational outcomes expected are a clear grasp of what differentiates convex sets from non-convex sets and how this relates to understanding function behavior graphically. The visualization will highlight relationships by visually representing the definition of a convex set and illustrate the cause-effect relationship between the epigraph and the convexity of the function, deepening the learner's insight into these foundational mathematical concepts.\n\n### Objective\nBy the end of this visualization, learners will be able to clearly differentiate between convex and non-convex sets, understand the geometric interpretation of epigraphs, and recognize the visual implications of a function\u2019s convexity, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of the principles of convexity in mathematics.",
