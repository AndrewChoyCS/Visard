    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition and characteristics of convex sets, specifically focusing on how the line segments connecting points within the set remain entirely within the set and how this translates to the epigraph of a convex function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their epigraphs in the context of mathematical functions. The goal is to illustrate how any straight line segment connecting two points in a convex set remains entirely within that set, as well as how the epigraph of a function relates to this definition. The visualization should clearly depict a graph of a convex function alongside its epigraph, using color-coded segments to highlight the relationship between points on the curve and those in the epigraph. A clear labeling of different sections will help students easily identify key components, such as the convex set, the epigraph, and the line segments. This will deepen their understanding of the properties of convexity in mathematical functions and foster insights into how these properties play a crucial role in optimization problems.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to recognize and describe the characteristics of convex sets and epigraphs, demonstrating a deep understanding of how these concepts are visually represented and their implications in mathematical analysis and optimization.",
