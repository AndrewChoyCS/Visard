    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The definition and visual characterization of convex sets, specifically through the epigraph of a function.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their epigraphs in relation to functions. The goal is to illustrate how a convex set is defined visually, emphasizing that a straight line connecting any two points within the set remains entirely within the set itself. Additionally, show the graph of a function and highlight its epigraph, which consists of points located on or above the curve. The visualization should clarify the relationship between the convexity of the function and its epigraph, utilizing a combination of graphical elements, such as shaded regions, line segments, and labeled axes. An infographic style would be suitable as it can effectively display these relationships and distinctions while guiding learners through the properties of convexity. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students will understand the foundational concept that defines a convex set and how it applies visually to functions and their epigraphs. They should be able to analyze and identify convex functions based on their graphical representations, reinforcing their skills in visualizing mathematical concepts and interpreting function behavior.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of convexity by accurately identifying and illustrating examples of convex sets and their associated epigraphs, fostering a deeper connection between graphical analysis and theoretical concepts in mathematical functions.",
