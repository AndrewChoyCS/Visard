    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The relationship between convex sets and the epigraph of a function, illustrating that a function is convex if the epigraph (points on or above the graph) forms a convex set.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in relation to convex sets and the epigraph of a function. The visualization should depict a convex set as a shaded area with straight lines connecting various points within it, ensuring these lines remain entirely within the shaded area. Additionally, illustrate the graph of a function f alongside its epigraph, highlighting that any line segment drawn between two points in the epigraph stays above the graph of the function. The goal of this visual representation is to clarify the relationship between the shape of the epigraph and the definition of a convex function, ultimately helping the learner understand how convexity influences the behavior of functions. By incorporating clear labels, contrasting colors, and labeled line segments, the visualization should emphasize the fundamental idea that if the epigraph is a convex set, the function itself is convex, aiding students in their understanding and retention of the concept.\n\n**Educational Objective**: Students will be able to visually differentiate between convex and non-convex functions by analyzing the representation of their epigraphs, thereby fostering a deep understanding of how the geometric properties of convex sets directly inform the characteristics of mathematical functions.",
