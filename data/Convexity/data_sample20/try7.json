    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Definition of Convex Sets and Their Epigraphs in Relation to Function Convexity**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain how a convex set is defined by the property that a straight line connecting any two points within the set remains entirely within the set. Additionally, illustrate the concept of an epigraph of a function and its relationship to convexity. The goal is to clearly demonstrate that a function is convex if its epigraph forms a convex set, meaning any line segment drawn on the graph will lie at or above the curve. \n\nThe visualization should include multiple graphs: one depicting a convex set with clear points and line segments, and another showing the epigraph of a function with annotations indicating how it relates to the concept of function convexity. Using a style such as an infographic or analytical diagram will help clarify these relationships visually. This visual will facilitate understanding by highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship between convexity in sets and functions while providing a comparative analysis of different sections of the graph.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe aim is to deepen learners' understanding of the concept of convexity by clearly illustrating the geometric properties of convex sets and the significance of epigraphs in the context of function convexity. By visualizing these relationships, students will better grasp how convexity influences function behavior and graph interpretation, solidifying their foundational knowledge in this area.",
