    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nA function is convex if the line segment between any two points on or above its graph (its epigraph) lies entirely at or above the graph itself.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the relationship between convex sets and their epigraphs in the context of convex functions. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how a function f is classified as convex based on the properties of its epigraph, particularly emphasizing that any line segment between two points on or above the graph remains above the graph. This will clarify the concept of convexity and help learners understand the geometric implications of convex functions. \n\nThe visualization should include a clear graph of a sample convex function alongside several lines representing line segments between various points on the graph, visually confirming that these segments lie above the curve. An infographic style showcasing the definition of a convex set alongside examples of non-convex sets for comparative analysis could also enhance understanding. This visual approach facilitates the recognition of cause-effect relationships between the definition of convexity and its graphical representation, leading to a more nuanced comprehension of the concept.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will demonstrate a deep understanding of convex functions by accurately identifying and illustrating the characteristics of their epigraphs, enabling them to differentiate between convex and non-convex functions through visual examples and graphical analysis.",
