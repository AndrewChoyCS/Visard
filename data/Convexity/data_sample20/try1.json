    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** A function \\( f \\) is convex if its epigraph, which consists of points located on or above the graph of \\( f \\), is a convex set. This implies that any line segment drawn between two points on the epigraph will remain above the curve of the function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex functions and their epigraphs. The goal is to illustrate how the properties of convex sets apply to the epigraph of a function \\( f \\). Specifically, the visualization should clarify the relationship between the graph of the function, the epigraph, and the definition of convexity, showcasing how any line segment connecting two points in the epigraph remains above the curve of the function. Suggested visualization styles could include a multi-panel diagram that displays the function graph, highlights the epigraph, and demonstrates methodically how varying line segments confirm the convex nature of the set. This visual approach will deepen learners' understanding of convexity by providing a clear graphical representation of relationships and reinforcing the concept through comparative analysis.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to accurately identify and characterize the properties of convex functions by analyzing the relationship between their epigraphs and graphs, thus developing a nuanced understanding of convexity in the context of functional analysis.",
