    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** A function f is convex if the straight line connecting any two points on its epigraph remains at or above the graph of the function itself.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convexity in functions through the representation of their epigraphs. The goal is to illustrate how a convex function's epigraph forms a convex set\u2014specifically, showing that any line segment connecting two points above the curve does not dip below the curve itself. The visualization should include a graph of a convex function with its epigraph shaded, alongside line segments between various points on the graph to reinforce the idea that all segments remain above the curve. An effective style could be a combination of a labeled diagram and an infographic that includes annotations outlining key properties of convexity. This visual representation will clarify the relationships between the function, its epigraph, and the criteria defining convexity, fostering a deeper understand of how these elements interact.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to visualize and articulate the defining properties of convex functions and their epigraphs, enabling them to recognize convexity in various mathematical contexts and appreciate its implications in optimization and analysis.",
