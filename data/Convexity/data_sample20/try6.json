    "data": "To simplify the concept, you can visualize convex sets as figures where a straight line connecting any two points within the set stays entirely within the set itself. This defines a convex set. When considering the graph of a function f, an epigraph consists of points that are located on or above the graph of the function. A function f is recognized as convex if its epigraph qualifies as a convex set. This means that any line segment drawn on the graph will always lie at or above the curve of the function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The concept of convex sets and the relationship between a function and its epigraph, illustrating that a function is convex if all line segments between any two points on its graph lie above or on the graph.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of convex sets and their epigraphs in relation to functions. This visualization should illustrate a graph of a function f, highlighting both its epigraph (the area above or on the graph) and convexity by showing several line segments between points on the graph that remain above the curve. The goal is to clarify the relationship between the geometric properties of convex sets and the definition of a convex function. This visualization could be styled as an infographic that includes labeled sections depicting the convex set, the epigraph, and the line segments, providing visual cues to enhance comprehension. By emphasizing these relationships and inequalities, learners will develop a deep understanding of how convexity influences function behavior and geometrical structure.\n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to analyze and articulate the properties of convex sets and their epigraphs, demonstrating how these concepts are fundamental to understanding the broader implications of convexity in mathematical functions.",
