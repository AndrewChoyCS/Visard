    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The concept of identifying a global minimizer in convex optimization through coordinate descent, specifically how minimizing along each coordinate axis leads to finding the overall minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Create a visualization to explain** the process of coordinate descent in identifying global minimizers in convex optimization. The visualization should illustrate how, starting from an initial guess, each coordinate is optimized sequentially while keeping other coordinates fixed, ultimately leading to a point where every coordinate axis has reached its minimum. \n\nThis visualization aims to clarify the iterative nature of the coordinate descent algorithm and how local minimization on each individual coordinate can accumulate to achieve a global minimum. It should utilize a flowchart format that shows the progression from the initial guess through successive iterations (k=1, 2, 3, etc.), highlighting the relationships between each coordinate's adjustments and the overall function value.\n\nBy visually guiding learners through this structured process, the audience will grasp the concept of how a local approach on each coordinate can effectively lead to a global optimization result in the context of convex functions. The expected educational outcomes include a deeper understanding of the sequential nature of coordinate descent, the importance of convexity in optimization, and the relationships between successive iterations.\n\n**Objective**: Learners will be able to articulate the mechanism of coordinate descent and explain how local optimizations across individual coordinates contribute to finding a global minimizer in convex optimization problems.",
