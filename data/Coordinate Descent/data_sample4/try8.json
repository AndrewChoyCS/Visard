    "goal": "### Core Principle:\n**Coordinate Descent Method for Minimization**\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the Coordinate Descent method used for finding global minimizers in a convex differentiable function.** The visualization should illustrate the iterative process of updating each coordinate one at a time, showing how the function's value is minimized sequentially along each axis. It should clarify the relationship between the starting point \\( x^{(0)} \\) and the subsequent iterative points \\( x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, \\ldots \\) leading to the minimization. \n\n### Suggested Visualization Style:\nA flowchart or step-by-step diagram would be ideal, with each step visually indicating how the coordinates are updated and the corresponding change in the function's value. Use a 3D surface plot of the function to depict the minimization landscape along with arrows indicating the movement towards the minimum along each coordinate axis.\n\n### Educational Outcomes:\nThis visualization aims to deepen the understanding of how local minimization along each coordinate axis can lead to a global minimizer in convex functions. It should highlight the sequential nature of the process, allowing learners to grasp the importance of each step in the iterative descent and how they build upon one another. The visual will also emphasize the significance of convexity in ensuring that local minima are also global minima, reinforcing these concepts through clear cause-effect relationships demonstrated in the visualization. \n\n### Learning Objective:\nStudents will be able to articulate the mechanics of the Coordinate Descent algorithm and its reliance on the properties of convex functions for achieving global minimization, enabling them to apply this understanding to solve optimization problems effectively.",
