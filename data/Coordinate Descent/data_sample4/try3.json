    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe process of using coordinate descent to find a global minimizer of a convex function by iteratively minimizing along each coordinate axis.\n\n### Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the sequential process of coordinate descent for finding a global minimizer of a convex function.** The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how, starting from an initial guess, each coordinate is optimized one at a time while keeping other coordinates fixed. This concept is intended to clarify the relationship between the iterative updates and the convergence towards a global minimum, highlighting the role of convexity in ensuring that local minima are also global minima. \n\n### Visualization Style\nSuggest using a **flowchart combined with graphical representations of the function landscape**. This visualization should depict a multi-dimensional landscape (in 2D or 3D) showing the convex function, with paths marked to indicate the iterative steps taken during the optimization process at each coordinate axis. \n\n### Educational Outcomes\nStudents will be able to understand the iterative nature of coordinate descent, the importance of convexity in guaranteeing solutions, and how optimizing one coordinate at a time contributes to finding a global minimum. By visualizing these relationships and sequences, learners will grasp the underlying mechanics of the algorithm, making the complex concept more accessible and intuitive.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective is to facilitate a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method's iterative optimization process, emphasizing the significance of convexity in obtaining global minima, which can enhance problem-solving skills in mathematical optimization and algorithm design.",
