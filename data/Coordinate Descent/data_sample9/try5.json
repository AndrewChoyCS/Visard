    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions by fixing some variables while varying others leads to easier subproblems that converge towards a solution.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how several elements of the variable vector \\( x \\) are held constant while others are adjusted to find an approximate minimum of the objective function. This visualization should clarify the sequence of steps involved in the method, highlighting the shift from high-dimensional problems to easier single-variable minimization. Consider utilizing a flowchart or infographic with graphical representations of the objective function, coordinate planes, and the variable vector \\( x \\) at various optimization stages. This visual will aid in understanding how fixing certain variables simplifies the problem-solving process and will enhance learners' grasp of the cause-and-effect relationships between the steps involved in coordinate descent.\n\n**Objective:** The visualization should deepen understanding of the coordinate descent method's iterative steps, enabling learners to clearly visualize and comprehend the transition from complex problems to simpler subproblems, fostering a robust grasp of multivariable optimization strategies.",
