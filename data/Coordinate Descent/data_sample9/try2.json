    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions by fixing certain variables and solving lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the method reduces complex optimization problems into simpler, lower-dimensional subproblems by fixing certain variables and iteratively minimizing the objective function across coordinate directions. This representation should clarify the sequential nature of the approach and highlight the cause-effect relationship between the fixing of variables and the resulting minimization outcomes. \n\nIn terms of visualization style, consider using a flowchart or a series of diagrams that depict each step of the coordinate descent process, highlighting transitions between dimensions and showing examples of fixed and active variables. This visual will enhance understanding by clearly mapping the relationships between the fixed variables and their impact on the minimization process, thereby allowing learners to grasp how each iteration builds upon the previous one.\n\n**Learning Objective:** The learner will understand how the iterative application of coordinate descent simplifies optimization tasks by reducing them to manageable subproblems, grasping the significance of fixing variables at each step and observing the overall optimization trajectory. This understanding will be deepened through the visualization of relationships and sequences in the method.",
