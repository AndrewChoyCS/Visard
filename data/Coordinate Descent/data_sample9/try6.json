    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing an objective function by fixing certain elements of a variable vector and solving lower-dimensional subproblems gives rise to a more manageable optimization process.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to depict how multiple elements of the variable vector are fixed while one variable is adjusted, illustrating the transition from a high-dimensional space to simplified, lower-dimensional subproblems. The visualization should explicitly clarify the sequence of operations involved in this process and the relationships between the fixed and variable elements, using diagrams or flowcharts to show each step clearly. By highlighting these relationships and sequences, the visualization will aid learners in grasping the underlying mechanics of coordinate descent, leading to a deeper understanding of its efficiency in solving complex optimization issues.\n\n**Objective:** To enable learners to comprehend the iterative nature and efficiency of coordinate descent methods, allowing them to visualize and differentiate between fixed and variable elements in the optimization process, thereby reinforcing their understanding of optimization strategies in lower dimensions.",
