    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent methods, where optimization is achieved by minimizing functions along specific coordinate directions and focusing on one variable at a time while holding others constant.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how optimization is achieved through sequential minimization along coordinate directions, emphasizing the transition from a high-dimensional problem to lower-dimensional subproblems. The visualization should depict the relationships between the fixed elements of the variable vector and those being optimized, illustrating how this approach simplifies the overall challenge. \n\nSuggested styles include a flowchart that sequentially outlines the steps of the coordinate descent process alongside a diagram showing the optimization landscape as it changes with each iteration. This visual should highlight the cause-effect relationship of fixing certain variables while optimizing others, ultimately leading to the convergence of the objective function. By utilizing clear labels and distinct color coding for different stages, learners will gain a deeper understanding of both the structure and efficiency of the coordinate descent method.\n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand the iterative optimization process of coordinate descent by visualizing how breaking down complex, high-dimensional problems into simpler, lower-dimensional subproblems enhances computational efficiency and clarity in the optimization pathway.",
