    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions by fixing certain variables in the coordinate descent method.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how multiple elements of the variable vector \\( x \\) can be fixed while minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining variables, illustrating the transition from higher dimensional problems to simpler, lower-dimensional subproblems. This visualization should highlight the sequence of steps involved in the optimization process, using a flowchart style combined with layered diagrams to show the progression from a complex problem to simplified variable minimization tasks. By visually representing the relationships and sequences in each optimization step, learners will gain a clearer, deeper understanding of how coordinate descent efficiently tackles optimization challenges. \n\n**Educational Objective:** The objective is to ensure that learners can grasp not only the fundamental steps in the coordinate descent method but also the underlying relationships between fixed variables and the reduced dimensionality of subproblems, leading to improved problem-solving skills in optimization contexts.",
