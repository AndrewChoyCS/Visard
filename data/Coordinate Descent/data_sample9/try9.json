    "data": "Coordinate descent methods address optimization challenges by iteratively minimizing functions along specified coordinate directions or coordinate planes. These methods work by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector x at their values from the previous step and then finding an approximate minimum of the objective function regarding the other remaining elements. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension, often scaling down to a single variable minimization problem, making them typically easier to solve compared to tackling the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of minimizing functions in coordinate descent methods by fixing multiple elements of the variable vector and addressing subproblems of lower dimensions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimizing functions. The goal is to illustrate how specific dimensions of the variable vector are fixed while the remaining elements are adjusted to find approximate minima, emphasizing the transition from multi-dimensional to single-variable minimization problems. This visualization should clarify the relationships and sequences involved in the process by presenting a flowchart combined with interactive graphical elements that demonstrate how each step leads to simpler subproblems. By visually portraying this process, learners will deepen their understanding of the mechanics behind coordinate descent and appreciate the systematic reduction in complexity while optimizing functions.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners should be able to articulate the sequential steps of coordinate descent, recognize the advantages of reducing dimensionality in optimization problems, and understand how fixing certain variables aids in reaching an approximate solution effectively. This deepens their conceptual grasp of optimization techniques and enhances their problem-solving skills in applied contexts.",
