    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of coordinate descent, where optimization is achieved by minimizing along specific variable directions while fixing other components.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent optimization methods. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration simplifies the optimization task into lower-dimensional problems by fixing certain variable components while optimizing the remaining ones. This concept should clarify the sequential process of fixing variables and minimizing the objective function, highlighting the relationships between full dimensionality and lower-dimensional scenarios. Suggested styles include a flowchart or series of graphs that visually represent the iterations of the coordinate descent method, showing fixed and variable components, and how each iteration leads to incremental improvement in the objective function. This visual aid should foster a deep understanding of how coordinate descent transforms complex problems into more manageable ones, emphasizing the connections and dependencies within the iterative process.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will gain a crucial understanding of how the iterative process of coordinate descent efficiently reduces the complexity of optimization problems, enhancing their ability to apply this method to real-world scenarios by visualizing the fixed and dynamic relationships among variable components throughout the optimization journey.",
