    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe iterative nature of coordinate descent methods that allows optimization tasks to be transformed into simpler, lower-dimensional problems.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimization. The goal is to depict how each iteration focuses on minimizing the objective function along one specific variable direction while keeping the other variables constant. This visualization should clarify the concept of transforming a multi-dimensional optimization problem into a simpler scalar or lower-dimensional problem. Consider using a series of diagrams or a flowchart to illustrate the progression of iterations, highlighting how each step narrows down the problem space. \n\nIncorporate visual elements to show the relationships between fixed variables and the minimized variable, as well as the objective function landscape. This visual should aid learners in understanding the efficiency of coordinate descent by illustrating sequential processes, thereby deepening their insight into why and how this method simplifies complex optimization tasks.\n\n**Objective:**\nAim for a deep understanding of how the iterative nature of coordinate descent allows for efficient optimization through simplification, thereby equipping learners with a clear grasp of the method's effectiveness and practical applications.",
