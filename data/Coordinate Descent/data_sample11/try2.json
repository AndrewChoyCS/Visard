    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent, where the variable vector \\( x \\) is partially fixed to minimize the objective function along specific dimensions.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent algorithm. The goal is to illustrate how the optimization task is simplified by fixing the majority of the variable components while minimizing along a specific direction or hyperplane. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the variable vector adjustments and the subsequent refinement of the objective function, showing each step of the iteration process. \n\nA flowchart or a series of layered diagrams would be ideal, depicting the original multi-dimensional optimization problem and breaking it down into sequential lower-dimensional minimization tasks. Highlighting the iterative nature and the transitions between fixed and variable components will serve to deepen learners' understanding of how these methodologies work. By visualizing these processes, students can more clearly grasp the cause-and-effect relationships inherent in coordinate descent, enabling them to better understand its application in optimization problems.\n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm\u2019s mechanics, helping learners to recognize how fixing certain dimensions simplifies the optimization process and how this aligns with broader strategies in numerical optimization.",
