    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent methods, which minimizes an objective function by sequentially optimizing individual variables while holding others constant, effectively simplifies complex optimization tasks into more manageable lower-dimensional problems.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to show how the method sequentially minimizes an objective function by adjusting one variable at a time while keeping the others fixed, thus transforming a high-dimensional problem into a simpler, lower-dimensional one. This visualization should clarify the sequential process of fixing majority components of the variable vector \\( x \\) in each iteration and highlight the resulting simplification of the optimization task.\n\nI suggest using a flowchart combined with graphs that represent the multi-dimensional space of the objective function. The flowchart can indicate the iterative steps taken in the optimization process, while each graph can illustrate specific stages where one variable is minimized (along hyperplanes) against the backdrop of fixed variables. This visual aid will help learners to understand the relationships between the components and appreciate how simplifying assumptions make complex optimization tasks more tractable.\n\n**Objective:** Foster a deep, critical understanding of how coordinate descent reduces complexity in optimization problems by visualizing sequences of variable adjustments, thus emphasizing the relationship between high-dimensional challenges and their lower-dimensional solutions.",
