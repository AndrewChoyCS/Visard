    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe iterative nature of coordinate descent methods, where only a subset of variable components is updated at each step while others are held fixed, leading to a transformation of the problem into lower-dimensional minimization tasks.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how, at each iteration, most components of the variable vector \\( x \\) are held constant while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to one or two components. This visualization should highlight the sequence of steps involved in transitioning from a high-dimensional optimization problem to simpler, lower-dimensional iterations. \n\nUse a flowchart style to display the iterative process clearly, depicting the fixed components alongside those that are varied in each step. Include arrows to indicate the progression from one iteration to the next, emphasizing the reduction of dimensionality as the process unfolds. By employing this visual representation, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization tasks, enhancing their grasp of key relationships and the overall mechanics of the method.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nDeeply understand the iterative nature and dimensionality reduction in coordinate descent methods, illuminating the relationship between fixed and variable components during optimization, and how this approach facilitates simpler problem-solving in high-dimensional contexts.",
