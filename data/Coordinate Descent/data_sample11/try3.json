    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of sequential minimization in coordinate descent, which simplifies the optimization task by minimizing iteratively along specific variable directions while holding other components fixed.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent optimization methods. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration holds most variable components constant while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to a subset of variables. This visualization should clarify the concept of transforming a high-dimensional optimization problem into a lower-dimensional one. Use a combination of infographics and flowcharts to depict the sequence of iterations, highlighting the relationships between fixed and variable components in the optimization process. By clearly showing this iterative minimization along specific directions, learners will gain a deep understanding of how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization tasks through structured, step-by-step processes.\n\n**Learning Objective:** \nFacilitate deep comprehension of the iterative and dimensional reduction processes in coordinate descent, emphasizing the relationship between fixed variables and the simplification of complex optimization problems.",
