    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Sequential minimization along specific variable directions in Coordinate Descent methods.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative nature of Coordinate Descent methods, highlighting how minimization occurs sequentially along specific variable directions. The goal is to show how, in each iteration, the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) remain fixed while focusing on the optimization of the remaining variables. This visualization should clarify the transformation of a complex optimization problem into a simpler, lower-dimensional minimization problem, revealing how each step builds on the last to progressively reach the optimal solution. \n\nI suggest using a flowchart or diagram that delineates the iterative process, with clear labeling of fixed and variable components at each stage. Additionally, include a sequence of graphs depicting the objective function's contours, illustrating both the minimization along individual variable directions and the convergence towards an optimal solution. This visual aid will deepen understanding by emphasizing the relationships between fixed components and the minimized variables, fostering a clear grasp of how Coordinate Descent simplifies optimization.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nTo achieve a deep and crucial understanding of the iterative process of Coordinate Descent, learners will be able to visualize the relationships between fixed and varying components during each minimization step and recognize how this sequential approach simplifies complex optimization problems.",
