    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative nature and strategy of sequential minimization in the coordinate descent optimization method.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent optimization, focusing on how the method sequentially minimizes an objective function by fixing most variable components and adjusting the remaining ones. The goal of this visualization is to clarify the concept of breaking down a complex optimization problem into simpler, lower-dimensional parts, emphasizing the sequence of iterations and the relationships between fixed and variable components. A flowchart or diagram illustrating each step in the iterative process, with annotations highlighting cause-effect relationships and periodic updates to the variable vector \\( x \\), would be particularly effective. This visual representation will aid students in understanding not only the mechanics of coordinate descent but also the efficiency gained from minimizing along specific variable directions, fostering a deeper comprehension of optimization strategies in numerical methods. \n\n**Educational Objective:** To ensure learners grasp the iterative procedure and strategic breakdown of coordinate descent, enabling them to articulate how this method efficiently tackles high-dimensional optimization problems through sequential decisions.",
