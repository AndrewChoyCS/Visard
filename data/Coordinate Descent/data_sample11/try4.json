    "data": "Coordinate descent methods tackle optimization problems by performing sequential minimization along specific variable directions or hyperplanes. These methods are iterative in nature, with each iteration achieved by holding the majority of the components of the variable vector \\( x \\) fixed at their current values, while roughly minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This approach transforms the optimization task into a lower-dimensional (or even scalar) minimization problem, which is generally simpler to solve than the full-scale issue at hand.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe sequential nature of the coordinate descent method, where most components of the variable vector are fixed during each iteration while one component is minimized.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimizing an objective function. The goal is to illustrate the step-by-step flow of minimizing the objective function while keeping the majority of the variable components fixed. Specifically, the visualization should clarify the relationship between fixed components and the component being optimized at each iteration, demonstrating how this successive approach simplifies the overall optimization problem. \n\nConsider using a flowchart or diagram that includes multiple iterations, clearly showing the variable vector \\( x \\) with labeled axes for the components involved. Highlight the fixed components and indicate the changes in the minimized component in different iterations. This visual will aid in understanding the iterative nature of the method, allowing learners to grasp the sequential relationships and progressions inherent in coordinate descent, and ultimately deepen their understanding of this optimization technique.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nTo develop a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method by visualizing the sequential minimization process, enabling learners to comprehend how fixing most variables facilitates simpler, lower-dimensional optimization and the relationships between iterations.",
