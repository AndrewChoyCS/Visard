    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where each iteration involves fixing most components of the variable vector and minimizing a lower-dimensional subproblem.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms in optimization. The visualization should illustrate how the algorithm fixes certain components of a variable vector and focuses on minimizing the remaining components in a lower-dimensional space. This can be effectively represented through a flowchart that depicts each iteration stage, highlighting the transition between different fixed variable configurations and the corresponding lower-dimensional minimization tasks. Additionally, an infographic section could provide comparative outcomes of the optimization at each step.\n\nThe goal is to depict the sequential process of the coordinate descent method, emphasizing the cause-effect relationships between fixing variables and achieving more manageable subproblems. By visualizing these relationships and steps, learners will gain a clearer understanding of how each iteration leads to an approximate solution and the underlying mechanics of the optimization process.\n\n**Learning Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of the iterative mechanics of coordinate descent algorithms, enabling students to appreciate how fixing components facilitates lower-dimensional problem-solving and contributes to overall optimization efficiency.",
