    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where optimization occurs by minimizing along selected coordinates while fixing others.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms in optimizing a multi-dimensional function. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration involves fixing certain components of the variable vector and focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This visualization should use a flowchart style to depict each step of the iteration, highlighting the transition from one iteration to the next and showing how lower-dimensional subproblems simplify the overall optimization process. \n\nBy illustrating the relationships between fixed and variable components, as well as the iterative nature of the method, learners will gain a clearer understanding of how coordinate descent optimizes complex functions step by step. Integrating arrows to indicate the sequential process and using color coding for fixed versus varying components will enhance comprehension and make the learning experience engaging.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of how coordinate descent algorithms leverage iterative minimization along specific components, enabling learners to recognize the systematic process of solving complex optimization problems effectively.",
