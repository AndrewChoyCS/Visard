    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of fixing components of a variable vector and minimizing the objective function in lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent algorithm. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration involves fixing components of the variable vector and subsequently minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the higher-dimensional optimization problem and its lower-dimensional subproblems through a sequential, step-by-step depiction of the process, ultimately highlighting the simplification achieved at each iteration. An infographic or flowchart style would be beneficial in demonstrating these sequences and relationships effectively. By breaking down the coordinate descent mechanism visually, learners will achieve a deep understanding of how and why this method enhances efficiency in optimization tasks.\n\n**Objective:** To develop a profound understanding of how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization problems by iteratively addressing lower-dimensional subproblems, leading to better insight into algorithm efficiency and applications in real-world scenarios.",
