    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: Iterative Minimization along Coordinate Directions**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration fixes components of the variable vector \\( x \\) while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to remaining components. This concept should clarify the relationship between high-dimensional problems and their lower-dimensional subproblems, showcasing how the iterative steps lead to an overall optimal solution. \n\nThe visualization should incorporate a flowchart or an infographic that sequentially depicts each step of the coordinate descent process, highlighting how one variable is adjusted while others remain constant. Using color coding to differentiate fixed components from the active ones can significantly aid in understanding the iterative nature and its simplification of complex problems. \n\nThis visual will deepen understanding by clearly demonstrating the cause-effect relationship between the fixed parts of the variable vector and the resultant simplification in the optimization process, ultimately leading to an enhanced grasp of coordinates in multidimensional optimization. \n\n**Objective:** \nTo foster a deep understanding of how coordinate descent iteratively simplifies an optimization problem by progressively minimizing along each coordinate direction, allowing learners to visualize and articulate the concept of reducing complexity in optimization strategies effectively.",
