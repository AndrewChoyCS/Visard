    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle: Iterative Approximation in Coordinate Descent\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain how coordinate descent algorithms utilize iterative approximation to solve optimization problems by sequentially minimizing along coordinate directions or hyperplanes. The visualization should depict the iterative process of fixing components of the variable vector and solving lower-dimensional subproblems, illustrating how each iteration leads closer to the optimal solution. Key educational outcomes include understanding the process of approximation in optimization, the reduction of dimensionality at each step, and the iterative nature of the algorithm. A flowchart with annotated steps and representative examples of graphical lower-dimensional minimizations (such as contours of a function) will help clarify the relationships and sequences involved in this procedure. By visualizing the step-by-step progression, learners can more easily grasp how coordinate descent methodically navigates the solution space, ultimately reinforcing the underlying mechanics of this optimization technique.\n\n### Objective: \nThe objective is to foster a deep understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, including the effectiveness of reducing dimensionality and the significance of each iteration's optimization, thereby enabling learners to apply this knowledge to complex optimization problems.",
