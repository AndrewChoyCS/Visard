    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe core principle to be visualized is the iterative process of coordinate descent, emphasizing how each iteration involves fixing most components of the variable vector and minimizing the objective along one coordinate direction or hyperplane.\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent optimization. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how each iteration involves fixing most variables while allowing one to be adjusted in isolation, illustrating the progression toward the optimal solution. This should incorporate a series of graphs displaying lower-dimensional subproblems with highlighted iterative paths to the local minimum, reflecting how each step simplifies the optimization task. \n\nUse a flowchart style alongside layered graphs that show transitions between iterations, with arrows indicating movement in the variable space, and labels clearly marking fixed and variable components throughout the process. \n\nBy visually differentiating between fixed and variable components, as well as the sequence of subproblem resolutions, this visual aims to deepen learners' understanding of the core mechanics of coordinate descent, the trade-offs of dimensionality, and the relationship between iterations and convergence toward an optimal solution.\n\n### Educational Objective\nLearners will develop a deep understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent, recognizing how isolating and minimizing one component at a time can simplify complex optimization problems, thereby grasping the efficiency and strategic framework of the method in computational optimization.",
