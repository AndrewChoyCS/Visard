    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\nThe iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, which involves fixing most components of a variable vector and minimizing over the remaining components, can be visualized to clarify the process and relationships involved in this optimization technique.\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms and how they approximate minimization by focusing on one coordinate direction at a time. The goal is to illustrate each iteration step where most components of the variable vector \\( x \\) remain fixed while a chosen component is varied for minimization. This representation will help learners grasp the sequential nature of solving lower-dimensional subproblems in the optimization process. \n\nThe visualization should take the form of a flowchart with separate steps showing how fixing and minimizing occurs across iterations. Additionally, incorporate a graphical representation of a multi-dimensional space with coordinate axes to accentuate which dimensions are being adjusted during each iteration. Highlighting the cause-effect relationships in each step will deepen learners' insight into how and why each iteration progressively leads to a more optimal solution.\n\n### Educational Objective\nThe objective is to facilitate a deep and crucial understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, specifically illustrating how fixing components and approximating minimization affects the solution trajectory. By visualizing this process, learners will better comprehend the dynamics of optimizing multi-dimensional problems by breaking them down into simpler, lower-dimensional components.",
