    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where most components of the variable vector are fixed while minimizing over the remaining components in a lower-dimensional space.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms and how they navigate the optimization landscape by fixing most components of a variable vector while minimizing over the remaining dimensions. The goal is to illustrate the sequential steps involved in reaching an optimal solution, highlighting how each iteration approximates the minimization in lower-dimensional subproblems. This visualization should utilize a flowchart or process diagram style, clearly delineating the transition from one iteration to the next, and visually depicting fixed and changing components of the variable vector. \n\nBy integrating labels, arrows to indicate movement between iterations, and perhaps color coding to differentiate between fixed and active dimensions, the visual will aid in understanding the relationships between dimensions and the effectiveness of breaking the problem into simpler, scalar subproblems. \n\n**Objective:** Students will gain a deep understanding of how the coordinate descent algorithm simplifies complex optimization problems by leveraging lower-dimensional minimization, enabling them to appreciate the method\u2019s efficiency and applicability in various optimization scenarios.",
