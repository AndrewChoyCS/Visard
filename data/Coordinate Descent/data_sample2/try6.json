    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms solve optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.They are iterative methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most components of the variable vector x at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining components. Each such subproblem is a lowerdimensional (even scalar) minimization problem, and thus can typically be solved more easily than the full problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, specifically how they approximate minimization by focusing on one coordinate or component at a time while fixing others.\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimization problems. The visualization should illustrate how an optimization problem is broken down into simpler, lower-dimensional subproblems by progressively fixing components of the variable vector and minimizing along the remaining coordinates. A flowchart could be effective in depicting the sequential steps involved in this process, showing how each iteration refines the solution. Key educational outcomes should include a deeper understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent, improved visualization of the convergence process toward a solution, and recognition of how fixing variables simplifies the optimization problem. By highlighting the relationships between the iterations and how they lead to more efficient problem-solving, the visual will significantly enhance comprehension of this core algorithmic strategy.\n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners grasp the essence of coordinate descent algorithms by visualizing the iterative minimization process, enhancing their ability to apply this method effectively in various optimization scenarios.",
