    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of finding a global minimum using the coordinate descent method by iteratively minimizing a convex function along each coordinate axis while holding others constant.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent method in finding a global minimum for a convex function. The goal is to clearly depict how each variable is updated sequentially while keeping others fixed, emphasizing the relationship between iterations; effectively showcasing how this method leads to a global minimum when each axis is minimized. \n\nThe visualization should utilize a combination of a flowchart and graphs to demonstrate the step-by-step updates that occur during the iterations, highlighting the cause-effect relationship between the current variable's update and the overall function's minimization. Including annotated graphs that illustrate the function\u2019s convex nature along different axes and the various points (x(k)) could enhance understanding. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the coordinate descent method, recognizing the significance of iterative updates in optimization processes. They will be able to visualize the connections between successive iterations and the minimum found along each axis, reinforcing the concept of convex functions and their global minimum properties. \n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand how the sequential minimization of each axis in the coordinate descent method contributes to reaching a global minimum in convex functions, while appreciating the iterative nature and the impact of each variable update on the overall function.",
