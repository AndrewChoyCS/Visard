    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:**\nThe process of applying the coordinate descent method to find the global minimum of a convex function by iteratively optimizing each variable while holding others fixed.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a convex function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\). The visualization should depict the sequence of updates across multiple dimensions, illustrating how each variable is optimized step-by-step while others are held constant. The goal is to clarify the relationship between the variables and demonstrate how convergence to the global minimum occurs through this method. \n\nUtilize a flowchart style combined with a 3D graph representing the convex function's surface. This will help learners visually track the changes in variables \\( x^k_1, x^k_2, \\ldots, x^k_n \\) at each iteration, showcasing the gradual approach toward the minimum point. Additionally, incorporating arrows and step indicators will emphasize sequential processes and reinforce the understanding of how each update builds upon the previous one.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to deepen students' understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm by illustrating the systematic optimization process, showcasing how iterations lead to convergence, and clarifying the function's structure in relation to the variables involved.",
