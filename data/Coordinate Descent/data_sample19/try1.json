    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The sequence of updates in the Coordinate Descent method, emphasizing the iterative process of minimizing a convex function along each coordinate axis while holding other variables constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Coordinate Descent method for minimizing a convex function. The goal should be to illustrate how the minimization occurs sequentially across multiple dimensions (coordinates) of the function's input. This visualization should clarify how each variable is updated one at a time while the others remain fixed, and it should represent the convergence towards a global minimum. \n\nTo achieve this, consider using a series of multi-dimensional graphs or plots that show contour lines of the convex function, highlighting the points where the function reaches a minimum along each axis through arrows or connecting lines. A step-by-step flowchart could also be integrated to depict the iterative updates over time (k = 1, 2, 3, ...), showing how each new value of x(k) builds on the previous iteration. \n\nThe visualization will aid learners in understanding the sequential relationships inherent in the process, promoting a deeper insight into how coordinate descent effectively narrows down to a global minimum. \n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will be able to articulate the systematic approach of the Coordinate Descent method, demonstrating their understanding of how specific variable updates contribute to optimizing a multi-dimensional, convex function.",
