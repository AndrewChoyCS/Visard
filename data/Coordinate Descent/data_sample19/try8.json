    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of finding a global minimum in a convex function using the coordinate descent method involves sequentially optimizing each variable while holding others constant.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the coordinate descent method for optimizing a convex function. The goal is to illustrate how the method iteratively adjusts each variable while keeping others fixed, showcasing the path taken towards the global minimum. This visualization should clarify the sequential updating process of variables (x(k)1, x(k)2, \u2026, x(k)n) and highlight the convergence to the global minimum through multiple iterations (k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026). \n\nUse a flowchart style to depict each step of the coordinate descent process\u2014showing the initial arbitrary point, the sequential updates for each variable, and the resulting movements toward the optimal point. Include graphs that represent the convex function and contour plots to visually emphasize the locations of minima along each axis.\n\nThis visual will deepen learners' understanding by clearly illustrating the relationships and sequences involved in the coordinate descent algorithm, allowing them to see how each adjustment influences the overall optimization process.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Learners will clearly understand the iterative nature of the coordinate descent method and how fixing certain variables while optimizing others contributes to reaching the global minimum of a convex function. This comprehension will enable them to apply the principles of coordinate descent in practical optimization problems.",
