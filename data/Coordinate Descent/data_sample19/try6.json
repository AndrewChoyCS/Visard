    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The process of finding a global minimum of a convex function using the coordinate descent method by iteratively optimizing one variable at a time while keeping others fixed.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent method for finding a global minimum of a convex function. The visualization should depict the function's contour plot showing the convexity, with clear markers representing the initial point \\(x(0)\\) and the sequence of points \\(x(k)\\) reached during each iteration. It should illustrate how the optimization of each variable in sequence leads to convergence towards the global minimum. Utilizing a flowchart style, the visual should highlight the relationships between the iterative updates, with arrows indicating the fixed variables and the variable being minimized at each step. \n\nThis visualization aims to deepen the learner's understanding of the sequential nature of coordinate descent and how fixing other variables influences convergence to the global minimum. By clearly showcasing the process, key educational outcomes include recognizing the importance of variable interactions in optimization, grasping the essence of convex functions, and understanding the structured approach of coordinate descent.",
