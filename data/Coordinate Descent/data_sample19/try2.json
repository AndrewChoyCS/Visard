    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The sequence and updates in the Coordinate Descent method, highlighting the iterative process of minimizing a convex function along each axis while holding other variables constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Coordinate Descent method for minimizing convex functions. The goal is to clarify how each variable is updated sequentially while keeping others fixed, ultimately leading to a global minimum. The visualization should represent the relationships between different iterations, showing how each update progresses along the axes of the function. A flowchart combined with graphical representations of the function landscape would effectively illustrate the movements through the variable space, capturing the idea of convergence to a minimum through successive adjustments. \n\nThis visual aids understanding by clearly depicting the iterative nature of the algorithm, how changes in one variable influence the overall minimization, and the eventual attainment of a global minimum. \n\n**Learning Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will develop a deep understanding of the Coordinate Descent method's quantitative process, emphasizing how localized updates facilitate convergence towards a global minimum, and recognizing the importance of convexity in ensuring successful optimization.",
