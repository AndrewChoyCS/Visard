    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The coordinate descent method allows for iterative optimization in convex functions by minimizing one variable at a time while holding others constant, leading to a global minimum when applied to functions reaching minimum values along each axis.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent method applied to a convex function. The goal is to illustrate how minimizing one variable at a time, while holding others constant, helps in converging to a global minimum. The visualization should clarify the sequential relationships of variable updates (x(k)1, x(k)2, ..., x(k)n) and how each step builds on the previous one. A flowchart or a series of labeled diagrams showcasing the optimization steps will effectively demonstrate this concept. This visual will enhance understanding by prominently highlighting the sequence of updates and the cause-effect relationships inherent in each iteration of the minimization process.\n\n**Objective:** Ensure learners grasp the significance of sequential variable updates in coordinate descent, emphasizing the relationship between each step and the overall optimization of the convex function, ultimately leading to a comprehensive understanding of how local improvements converge to a global solution.",
