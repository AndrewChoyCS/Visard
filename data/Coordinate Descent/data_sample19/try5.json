    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The coordinate descent method iteratively minimizes a differentiable, convex function by updating each variable one at a time while holding other variables constant, ultimately leading to a global minimum.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent method for optimizing a convex function. The visualization should depict the multi-dimensional landscape of the function, clearly showing how each variable is adjusted sequentially to minimize the function along each axis. Incorporate a series of plots that illustrate the progression from an initial arbitrary point to the global minimum, highlighting each iteration's steps and showing how the updated values influence the next calculations. This approach will clarify the relationships between the variables, the sequential progression of the updates, and the convergence toward the global minimum. \n\n**Visualization Style:** Use a layered diagram with graphs representing the function's contours, arrows indicating the movement from one point to the next, and annotations labeling each iteration step. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** This visualization should enhance understanding of how the coordinate descent method operates, providing insight into the significance of holding other variables constant during updates. By visualizing these steps, learners will grasp the sequential nature of the algorithm and the role of each variable in reaching the optimal solution. \n\n**Objective:** Enable learners to deeply understand the iterative nature of the coordinate descent method, recognizing how each variable's adjustment contributes to minimizing the overall function in a structured way.",
