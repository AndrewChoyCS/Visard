    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of the Coordinate Descent method, where each coordinate is optimized sequentially while holding others constant, ultimately converges to a global minimum in a convex function landscape.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Coordinate Descent method. The visualization should illustrate how the method starts from an arbitrary point and minimizes one coordinate at a time, showing the updates through each iteration until a global minimum is reached. It should clearly depict the relationship between the current point, the values held constant, and the progressively updated coordinates, effectively showcasing the trajectory towards the global minimum in a convex function space. \n\nBy using a combination of diagrams to represent the function's surface, arrows to indicate the direction of descent, and a sequence of iterations on a graph, the viewer can visualize how local movements lead to a global solution. This style will enhance understanding by emphasizing the sequential nature of the process and the effect of each optimization step. \n\n**Objective:** To deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of the Coordinate Descent method by illustrating its sequential optimization process, emphasizing the relationship between each step and the convergence to a global minimum in convex functions, thereby fostering a clear grasp of the method's functionality and advantages.",
