    "data": "Consider a differentiable function f: R^n \u2192 R that is also convex. If we find a point x at which f(x) reaches a minimum along each axis, we can conclude that we have located a global minimum. This insight implies that for a function structured as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3ni=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable, and each hi is convex), we can effectively apply the coordinate descent method. We initiate the process with an arbitrary point x(0) and repeatedly execute the following updates: for iteration k, we determine x(k) by minimizing in sequence - first finding x (k) 1 that satisfies the minimization relative to f while holding the other variables as fixed at the values from the previous iteration: x(k-1) 2, x(k-1) 3, ..., then continuing similarly to find x (k) 2 while keeping x (k) 1 fixed, and proceeding onwards through x(k) 3, up to x(k) n, iterating through k = 1, 2, 3, ... . Note that we use the updated value of x (k) i throughout the subsequent calculations after each paradise solution.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of identifying a global minimum in a convex function through sequential minimization along each axis, as illustrated by the coordinate descent method.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the coordinate descent method for finding the global minimum of a convex function. The goal is to clarify the sequential process of minimizing along each axis while holding other variables fixed. This visualization should depict an example of a convex function in R\u00b2, demonstrating how each iteration updates the variable values and how these updates contribute to achieving the global minimum. Consider using a combination of a 3D surface plot to represent the function, overlaid with arrows to indicate the direction of minimization and points marking the values at each iteration. \n\nThe visualization should highlight the relationships between the variables, the sequential nature of the updates, and the convergence towards the global minimum. By illustrating these aspects, the visual will aid in deepening learners' insights into how coordinate descent operates within the framework of convex optimization.\n\n**Educational Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will gain a crucial understanding of the iterative process of coordinate descent, recognizing how minimizing along each axis contributes to achieving a global minimum in a convex function. They will grasp the cause-and-effect relationships intrinsic to this method and visualize the algorithm's practical application, enhancing their comprehension of optimization techniques in higher dimensions.",
