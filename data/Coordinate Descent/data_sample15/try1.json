    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a multivariable function by updating one variable at a time while fixing others.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent applied to the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal is to illustrate how optimizing along one coordinate direction (x-axis) influences the overall minimization when other coordinates (y) are held constant. Specifically, this visualization should clarify the relationship between the initial point, the updated points after each iteration, and the trajectory toward the minimum of the function. \n\nUtilize a combination of line graphs and 3D surface plots to depict the function's landscape, highlighting the path taken from the initial point to subsequent optimization steps. Incorporate clear labels and color coding to differentiate between the fixed variable and the moving variable, illustrating how these steps converge toward the optimal solution. This structured visualization will deepen learners' understanding of the sequential nature of coordinate descent and the inherent limitations of this method in optimizing multivariable functions.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Facilitate a deeper understanding of the coordinate descent method as a sequential optimization strategy, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationships between fixed and variable coordinates in the context of multivariable functions.",
