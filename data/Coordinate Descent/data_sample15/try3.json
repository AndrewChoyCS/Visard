    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of multivariate minimization using coordinate descent, highlighting the optimization in one dimension by fixing a variable.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the process of multivariate minimization using coordinate descent as applied to the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\). The goal of the visualization is to clearly illustrate how fixing one variable (y) allows for the focus on a one-dimensional optimization along the x-axis. This should include step-by-step representations of the optimization process, showing both the initial point and the subsequent steps toward the minimum, emphasizing the limitations of moving along coordinate directions. A combination of contour plots to represent the function in two dimensions and line graphs to depict the one-dimensional optimization process would effectively convey these ideas. By doing this, the visualization will facilitate a deeper understanding of coordinate descent by highlighting the relationships between the original function and its one-dimensional slices, as well as the sequential nature of the optimization steps.\n\n**Objective**: Enable learners to deeply understand how coordinate descent optimizes multivariate functions by breaking the problem into simpler one-dimensional optimizations, revealing both the relationships between dimensions and the progression toward minimizing the function.",
