    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of moving toward a minimum in multivariate optimization using Coordinate Descent, specifically through fixing one variable and optimizing over another.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of Coordinate Descent in the context of the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal is to illustrate the optimization steps taken from the initial point (-1, -1) towards the minimum by fixing the variable y and optimizing along the x-axis. This visualization should clarify how the movement in individual coordinate directions leads to progress, highlighting the sequential steps in the optimization process and the gradual convergence toward the minimum.\n\nThe visual should consist of a series of graphs or a diagram showing the contour plot of the function, the initial point, and annotations for each optimization step taken along the x-axis (while y is fixed at -1). Additionally, a smaller inset could depict the one-dimensional function being optimized at each step. This design will allow students to see relationships between coordinate movements and the resulting changes in function value, clearly illustrating the cause-effect relationship inherent in the coordinate descent method.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent in multivariate optimization, understanding how fixing one variable aids in identifying the minimum of a quadratic function, and articulate the significance of sequential steps in reaching an optimal solution.",
