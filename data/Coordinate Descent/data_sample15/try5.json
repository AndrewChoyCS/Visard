    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of multivariate minimization through coordinate descent and its limitations.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of multivariate minimization using coordinate descent, specifically focusing on the optimization steps taken from an initial point. The visualization should illustrate how only one variable is adjusted at a time\u2014showing first the path taken along the x-axis while y is fixed, followed by the adjustment in the y-axis while x is held constant. The goal is to clarify the sequential nature of coordinate descent, including the progress towards the minimum of the function and the limitations of this method, which only allows directional movements.\n\nThe visualization could utilize a series of graphs that plot the quadratic function in three dimensions, clearly marking the initial point, the fixed values during each optimization step, and the trajectory toward the minimum. An infographic style with arrows to indicate movement directions and annotations to highlight the changes in function values at each step would be effective. This design will help learners grasp the cause-effect relationships inherent in the optimization process and the trade-offs involved in the coordinate descent method.\n\n**Objective:** Deepen learners' understanding of how coordinate descent operates within multivariable functions, emphasizing the sequential nature of optimization and the constraints imposed by fixing variables at each step.",
