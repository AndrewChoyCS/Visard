    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The process of multivariate minimization using coordinate descent, particularly emphasizing the optimization steps and the impact of fixing one variable at a time in a quadratic function.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of multivariate minimization through coordinate descent applied to the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal is to illustrate how fixing one variable (y at -1) allows for the analysis of a one-dimensional function along the other variable (x-axis). This visualization should highlight the sequential steps taken in the optimization process, the movement towards the minimum, and the challenges faced by being restricted to individual coordinate directions. Suggested styles include a layered diagram that shows the 3D surface of the function, paths taken during optimization, and the one-dimensional slice with marked minima. The visual should clearly delineate the cause-effect relationship of each optimization step and engage the viewer in understanding the progression towards the minimum point.\n\n**Objective**: By engaging with this visualization, learners will deepen their understanding of how coordinate descent works, grasp the significance of fixing variables, and recognize the limitations presented by this method in multivariate optimization contexts.",
