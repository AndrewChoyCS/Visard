    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe iterative process of coordinate descent for multivariate minimization, focusing on the method of solving one-dimensional optimization problems by fixing one variable at a time.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent applied to the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how fixing one variable allows for the optimization of the other, showing the iterative steps taken from the initial point (-1, -1) toward the minimum value. Specifically, the visualization should clarify the relationship between the two-dimensional function and the one-dimensional functions created by fixing y at -1, including how each step progresses towards the minimum. \n\nConsider using a dynamic infographic that includes both 3D surface plots of the quadratic function and a series of 2D cross-sectional graphs of the function while varying x and fixing y. This approach will help highlight the cause-effect relationship of optimizing one variable at a time and present sequential optimization steps distinctly. The visual should enhance understanding by clearly illustrating how these iterative movements converge towards the optimal solution while reinforcing the learner's grasp of multivariate function behavior.\n\n**Objective:**\nDevelop a profound understanding of the coordinate descent method by visualizing the iterative optimization process in a multivariate context, enabling learners to appreciate how fixing one variable can simplify the problem and clarify the path toward convergence in a systematic manner.",
