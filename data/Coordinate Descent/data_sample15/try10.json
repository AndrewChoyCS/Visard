    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of multivariate minimization using coordinate descent to find the minimum of a function by optimizing one variable at a time while fixing others.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent in finding the minimum of a quadratic function, specifically f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal of the visualization should be to illustrate the iterative steps taken from the initial point (-1, -1) toward the function's minimum by optimizing one variable at a time\u2014first x while fixing y at -1. The visual should clearly depict the function's surface, indicate the trajectory taken during optimization, and compare the values of the function at each step. Suggested styles include a 3D surface plot coupled with a 2D cross-section graph and annotated step-by-step labels. This approach will help learners intuitively grasp the sequence of movements, the relationships between variable optimization, and the resulting progression towards the solution, ultimately enhancing their understanding of multivariate minimization techniques.\n\n**Objective:** Learners will achieve a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method, effectively grasping how optimization occurs through the systematic adjustment of individual variables while observing the impact on the function's value, thereby solidifying their grasp of iterative optimization strategies.",
