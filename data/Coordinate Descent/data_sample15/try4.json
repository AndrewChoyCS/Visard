    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe core principle to visualize is the process of coordinate descent optimization in multivariate functions, specifically how fixing one variable facilitates the minimization of a function along a single dimension.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the coordinate descent optimization process applied to the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal is to illustrate how fixing one variable (y = -1) allows us to analyze the minimization along the x-axis and how this leads to successive improvements toward the overall minimum of the multivariate function. \n\nThe visualization should include a 3D surface plot of the function alongside a 2D cross-section that shows the resulting one-dimensional function as y is held constant, marked with the progress of optimization steps. Label these steps clearly to highlight how each movement along the x-axis brings us closer to the minimum. This can be complemented with arrows showing the direction of descent and annotations indicating the calculated values at each step.\n\nBy using a combination of surface plots and dynamic movement along the axes, the visualization will elucidate the relationship between fixed and variable dimensions in coordinate descent, while reinforcing the concept of sequential optimization. \n\n**Educational Objective:**\nStudents will achieve a deep understanding of how fixing variables in coordinate descent allows us to simplify the minimization problem into manageable one-dimensional tasks, leading to a comprehensive comprehension of multivariate optimization techniques. This will foster critical thinking in understanding the limitations and advantages of coordinate descent as applied in more complex scenarios.",
