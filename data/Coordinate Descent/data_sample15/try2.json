    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of multivariate minimization through coordinate descent, focusing on one-dimensional optimization along individual coordinates.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of coordinate descent in the context of multivariate minimization using the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The visualization should illustrate the process of fixing one variable and optimizing along the other, specifically showing how fixing \\( y \\) at -1 allows us to minimize along the \\( x \\)-axis. It should highlight the sequential steps taken during optimization by marking the initial point, the subsequent positions after each optimization step, and the movement toward the minimum. Using a combination of a two-dimensional contour plot (to visualize the surface of the function) and a one-dimensional line plot (to display the progress along the x-axis), this visualization will help learners understand the relationship between the two dimensions and the iterative nature of coordinate descent. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deep and clear comprehension of the coordinate descent process, the understanding of how fixing a variable influences the minimization of a function, and the recognition of the inherent limitations of optimizing along individual coordinates only. By integrating sequential and comparative elements, the visual aids in grasping how each step contributes to approaching the function's minimum, reinforcing the cause-effect relationship inherent in multivariate optimization.",
