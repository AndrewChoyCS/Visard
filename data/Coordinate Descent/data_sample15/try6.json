    "data": "Consider a simple quadratic function, such as f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. Starting from an initial point at (-1, -1), we can examine how multivariate minimization works by applying coordinate descent to this function. By fixing y at -1, we can analyze the one-dimensional function along the x-axis to identify its minimum, since the resulting function is also quadratic. After two steps of optimization, we notice significant progress toward the minimum, although there's more work required as we are limited to movements along the individual coordinate directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in multivariate optimization, where one variable is optimized at a time while keeping others fixed, leading to progressive refinement toward the function's minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + x*y. The goal is to illustrate how optimization occurs by fixing one variable while optimizing the other, allowing learners to visualize the steps taken from the initial point (-1, -1) towards the function's minimum. This visualization should clearly show the changes in the function values as one coordinate is manipulated, highlighting the relationship between the fixed and the moving variable during optimization. \n\nUtilize a combination of 3D surface plots and 2D cross-sectional graphs to depict the quadratic function and the trajectory of optimization steps. The layered visuals will elucidate how movements are constrained to individual coordinates, making clear the sequential process of coordinate descent. \n\nBy integrating color-coding to indicate progress toward the minimum and arrows to show directionality of optimization, this visualization will aid in deeply understanding the concept of coordinate descent, ensuring that learners grasp the method's underlying relationships and the importance of each step in the iterative process.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a comprehensive understanding of how coordinate descent operates in multivariate optimization by visualizing the iterative movements between fixed and changing coordinates, thereby reinforcing the connection between theoretical principles and practical application in optimization techniques.",
