    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing a multivariable function using coordinate descent, specifically through one-dimensional optimization along a specific axis.\n\n---\n\n**Create a visualization to explain how coordinate descent iteratively minimizes a multivariable function along the x-axis while keeping y constant.** The visualization should depict the two-dimensional landscape of the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with a highlighted line representing y = -1. Along this line, show the quadratic curve formed from fixing y at -1 and illustrate the starting point (-1, -1), the subsequent points after each iteration (to demonstrate movement towards the minimum), and the final position relative to the minimum value.\n\nThis visualization aims to clarify the concept of how coordinate descent restricts its movement to specific axes, illustrating the sequential nature of optimization as it hones in on the minimum. Incorporate a graph style that combines 3D surface plotting for the overall function with a 2D cross-section for the specific path of descent along the y = -1 line. By clearly showing the steps taken in each iteration and how they converge towards the minimum, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the iterative process involved in coordinate descent and the relationships between variables. \n\n**Key Educational Outcomes:**\n1. Understand the concept of restricting optimization to one variable while fixing another.\n2. Visualize the path taken towards the minimum along a specific axis.\n3. Recognize how iterative methods refine positions in a multivariable context.",
