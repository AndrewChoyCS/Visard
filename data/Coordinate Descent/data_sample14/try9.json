    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative approach of Coordinate Descent in minimizing a function along one dimension while holding other dimensions constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent using the function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) with the starting point at (-1, -1) and focusing on minimizing along the x-axis while keeping y = -1. The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the function behaves as we move along the x-axis and identify the changes in the output values through each iteration. The concept is intended to clarify the influence of the fixed variable on the path toward the minimum and how each iteration brings us closer to that minimum point. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a layered 2D graph that shows the surface of the function \\( f(x, y) \\) alongside a highlighted projection of the one-dimensional path we take along \\( y = -1 \\). Include markers for the initial point, the calculated points after each iteration, and the minimum value attained. This style encourages an understanding of relationships between the coordinates and their outputs, showcasing both the sequential adjustments made through iterations and the cause-effect relationship of adjusting \\( x \\) while holding \\( y \\) constant. \n\n**Objective**: The objective is to facilitate a deep understanding of how Coordinate Descent functions in a multidimensional context while simplifying complex interactions into manageable visual representations, enabling learners to better grasp the iterative method and its implications for optimization problems.",
