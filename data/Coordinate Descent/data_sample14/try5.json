    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The operation of coordinate descent in optimizing a multivariable function by iteratively adjusting one variable at a time while keeping others constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, focusing on the iterative minimization along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration brings the initial point closer to the minimum point along a one-dimensional curve formed at y = -1. This visualization should include a graph plotting f(x, -1) against x, highlighting the initial point at (-1, -1) and showing the subsequent positions after each iteration. \n\n**Visualization Style**: A dynamic line graph combined with annotated markers and arrows to trace the path of successive iterations towards the minimum.\n\n**Educational Outcomes**: Learners will achieve a clear understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent, recognizing how adjusting one variable impacts the overall function's output. The visual will aid in understanding the sequential progress towards the minimum and the confinement of adjustments within coordinate axes, thereby deepening insight into optimization processes. This approach emphasizes relationships and sequences, highlighting cause-effect dynamics as learners observe how each iteration shifts the state closer to optimization.",
