    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of minimizing a quadratic function using coordinate descent, specifically highlighting the movement along one axis while keeping the other constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, starting from the point (-1, -1). The goal is to illustrate how we minimize the function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. The visualization should clarify the relationship between the original function and its one-dimensional projection along the specified axis, vividly demonstrating the movement towards the minimum with each iteration. \n\nUtilizing a combination of line graphs to represent the function's behavior, annotated points to highlight initial and subsequent iterations, and a clear depiction of the y = -1 line will enhance understanding. An infographic style would be effective, integrating snapshots of the function's shape, indicating the minimum at each step, and showcasing how the coordinates change through the iterations. This will help learners grasp how coordinate descent operates in a stepwise manner, emphasizing the iterative nature and path taken to reach the minimum, leading to deeper insights into optimization techniques.\n\n**Objective**: By the end of this visualization, learners should be able to identify and articulate the mechanics of coordinate descent, understand the significance of iteration in optimization, and recognize the method's movement constraints within specified dimensions.",
