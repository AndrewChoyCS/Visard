    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent, as applied to minimize a quadratic function by adjusting one variable at a time while holding others constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\). The goal is to illustrate how the starting point at (-1, -1) progresses toward the minimum value along the x-axis by keeping y constant at -1. This visualization should clarify the concept of minimizing a multi-dimensional function one variable at a time, highlighting the relationships between the 3D function surface and the 2D section defined at \\( y = -1 \\). \n\nUtilize a combination of 3D surface plots and 2D cross-sections, with clear annotations to indicate the successive positions after each iteration, allowing viewers to easily follow the path of descent. Incorporate arrows to demonstrate the movement along the x-axis and use color coding to distinguish the initial position, intermediate steps, and the final minimum. This approach emphasizes the relationship between the overall function and its simplified one-dimensional path, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of the coordinate descent method and its sequential nature. \n\n**Objective:** The visualization should enhance learners' insights into the iterative nature of coordinate descent, fostering comprehension of how strategic adjustments in one variable can lead to convergence on a minimum in a multi-variable context.",
