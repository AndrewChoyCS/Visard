    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing a function in coordinate descent, specifically along one dimension while fixing another variable.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. The goal is to visually demonstrate how we minimize the function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1, highlighting the relationship between each iteration and the resulting position on the curve. This visualization should include a series of plots: one showing the initial position at (-1, -1), another showing the line where y = -1, and then additional plots updating the position after each iteration. \n\nThe educational outcomes expected from this visual representation include a deep understanding of how each iteration brings us closer to the minimum, the nature of quadratic functions, and the concept of restricting movement to coordinate axes. Utilizing a sequential infographic style will clarify the cause-effect relationship inherent in the iterative process of coordinate descent and provide an intuitive grasp of the minimization strategy by showing progress visually. This approach aids learners in comprehending not only the steps involved but also the overarching principle of optimization in multi-dimensional landscapes.",
