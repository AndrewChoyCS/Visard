    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of minimizing a function in coordinate descent by altering one variable at a time while keeping others constant.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the method systematically approaches the minimum value by focusing on one coordinate axis at a time, specifically showing the path taken along the x-axis while y remains fixed at -1. This visual should incorporate a graph that highlights the function in a 3D coordinate system, overlaying a 2D slice at y = -1 to emphasize the one-dimensional minimization process. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of an interactive animation that demonstrates two or more iterations, marking the initial point and subsequent positions clearly with arrows or paths. It should engage learners by illustrating the concept of convergence and how each iteration brings us closer to the minimum, thus providing a clear understanding of sequential processes and cause-effect relationships within coordinate descent. By visually distinguishing between the multidimensional function and the one-dimensional approach, learners will develop a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind minimizing functions with coordinate descent. \n\n**Learning Objective**: Learners will be able to comprehend the iterative nature of coordinate descent and how adjusting one variable while holding others constant facilitates finding minimum values in multi-dimensional optimization problems.",
