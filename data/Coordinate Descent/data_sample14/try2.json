    "data": "Let's consider a simple quadratic function to delve into how coordinate descent operates. We'll use the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with an initial starting point at (-1, -1). Our objective is to minimize this function along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. By plotting a line at y = -1, we can determine the minimum value in this one-dimensional curve formed, which is also a quadratic function due to the nature of f. After conducting two iterations, we narrow our position significantly towards the minimum, albeit we still have further adjustments to make, as our movement is restricted to the dimensions of the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The process of optimizing a multi-variable function using Coordinate Descent, specifically illustrating the iterative minimization along one axis while holding another variable constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, starting from the point (-1, -1) and minimizing while keeping y constant at -1. The visualization should include two key components: a 3D surface plot of the function to illustrate the overall shape of the quadratic function and a 2D cross-section plot along the line y = -1 to show the specific minimization process on that axis. Each step of the optimization should be highlighted, demonstrating how the algorithm converges towards the minimum value with each iteration. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the concept of moving within a multi-dimensional space by restricting movement to one dimension at a time and to show the relationship between the function's geometry and the optimization steps. This will deepen learners' understanding of Coordinate Descent by visually depicting the cause-and-effect nature of each iteration and emphasizing how these individual moves contribute to finding the overall minimum. A combination of 3D surface visuals and annotated 2D plots will facilitate better comprehension of the relationships and sequences involved in the coordinate descent process. \n\n**Objective:** Ensure learners can articulate the methodology and significance of Coordinate Descent, appreciating how iterative optimization functions within confined dimensions to effectively minimize multi-variable functions.",
