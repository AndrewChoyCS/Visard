    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe iterative process of the coordinate descent method to find a global minimizer of a differentiable convex function by sequentially optimizing along each coordinate axis.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent algorithm. The goal is to illustrate how the algorithm updates each coordinate sequentially to minimize a differentiable convex function. By visually representing each iteration as a step along the coordinate axes, learners can clearly see how the values change and converge toward the global minimum. \n\nThe visualization should include a multi-dimensional graph showing the function landscape, paths taken by the algorithm, and milestones reached at each step. This could be designed as an animated flowchart or an infographic, depicting the updates in a step-by-step progression while highlighting the cause-effect relationships between each coordinate update and the overall function value. \n\nUsing this visual will deepen the learner's understanding of how successive updates lead to optimization, reinforcing the importance of each coordinate\u2019s effect on the overall minimization process. \n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will accurately describe how coordinate descent operates through a series of iterative updates and demonstrate the relationship between coordinate adjustments and the pursuit of a global minimum in a multi-dimensional convex landscape.",
