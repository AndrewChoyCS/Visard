    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative updating process in Coordinate Descent for finding global minimizers of a convex function through sequential optimization along coordinate axes.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent in optimizing a differentiable convex function. The goal is to clarify how each coordinate is updated sequentially to move towards a global minimizer. This visualization should highlight the relationships between the initial point, subsequent updates, and the convergence towards the optimal solution. Consider using a flowchart or a step-by-step diagram to represent the series of updates, making it easier for learners to follow the sequence of operations and understand how each update is dependent on the previous values. Emphasizing the stepwise nature of the process will deepen students' understanding of how Coordinate Descent functions to efficiently locate minimizers by illustrating both the mechanics of the updates and the overarching goal of achieving a global minimum.\n\n**Educational Outcome:** Students will gain a crucial understanding of how iterative updates in Coordinate Descent are structured and their role in finding global minimizers of convex functions, enhancing their comprehension of optimization methods in mathematical contexts.",
