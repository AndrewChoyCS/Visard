    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative updating process of coordinate descent to find a global minimizer in a differentiable convex function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative updating process of coordinate descent applied to a differentiable convex function. The goal is to illustrate how starting from an initial guess, the optimization process sequentially updates each coordinate to minimize the function effectively. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the initial guess and the progressive updates of each coordinate, emphasizing the convergence to a global minimizer. \n\nUse a flowchart style to depict each step of the coordinate descent algorithm, showing the transitions between coordinates as they are updated. Include graphical representations of the function minimized at each coordinate step to visually convey the concept of moving towards the minimum. \n\nThis visual aid will help deepen the learner\u2019s understanding of how iterative updates work and the cause-effect relationships between each step in the optimization process, ultimately leading to the identification of the global minimizer.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm by visualizing the sequential optimization process and the relationships among the coordinates, supporting learners in comprehending how each update contributes to minimizing the overall function.",
