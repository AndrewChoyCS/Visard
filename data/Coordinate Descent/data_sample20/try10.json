    "goal": "### Core Principle\n**The iterative process of coordinate descent for minimizing a convex function through sequential updates along each coordinate axis.**\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent as a method for finding a global minimum for a differentiable convex function. The visualization should illustrate the sequential updating process, showing how at each iteration k, one variable is optimized while keeping others constant, culminating in an eventual convergence to the global minimum. Emphasize the relationships between iterations, the function landscape, and how each update moves closer to the minimum. \n\nA suggested style could be a combination of an infographic and a flowchart. Diagrams of the function's contours alongside progress markers indicating the points of update in each iteration will help learners visualize the optimization journey. Best practices in instructional design should be employed by clearly showing cause-effect relationships through arrows, labeling key points, and differentiating between steps to allow for comparative analysis between iterations.\n\n### Learning Objective\nThe objective is to promote a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method by enabling learners to visualize how an initial guess is refined through a series of systematic and strategic updates across multiple iterations, which ultimately guides them to the global minimum of a convex function.",
