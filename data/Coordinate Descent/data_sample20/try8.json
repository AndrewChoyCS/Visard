    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in finding the global minimizer of a differentiable convex function.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent for finding a global minimizer of a differentiable convex function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\). The goal of the visualization is to clarify how each coordinate is updated sequentially to minimize the function, emphasizing the relationships between the current point, the updates made at each step, and the convergence towards the minimum. This should depict the progression from an initial guess \\( x(0) \\) to \\( x(k) \\) through each coordinate update, showcasing the impact of individual axis adjustments on the overall function value. \n\nConsider employing a flowchart or a series of step-by-step plots that illustrate the path taken in the function's landscape as coordinates are varied. Highlight cause-and-effect relationships between each update and the resulting function value, fostering a deeper understanding of convergence dynamics in coordinate descent. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a robust understanding of the iterative nature and mechanics of coordinate descent, enabling them to apply this optimization technique effectively in various contexts.",
