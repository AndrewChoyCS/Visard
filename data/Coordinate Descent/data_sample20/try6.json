    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in minimizing a convex function by updating each coordinate sequentially.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent as a method for minimizing a convex function. The goal is to illustrate the sequential updates made to each coordinate, highlighting how each step moves closer to the global minimum. This visualization should clarify the concept of minimizing a multivariate function through coordinate-wise optimization, emphasizing the relationships between each coordinate update and the overall convergence towards the minimum. \n\nConsider using a flowchart combined with a graph plot that illustrates the function\u2019s landscape and the path taken by the iterative updates. Each update step should be distinctively labeled, showing how the coordinates change while keeping other coordinates fixed. This visual will aid learners in grasping the cause-effect relationship between the updates and the minimization process, enhancing their understanding of how coordinate descent operates. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of how coordinate descent utilizes iterative updates to progressively minimize a convex function, reinforcing their grasp of the sequence involved in the optimization process.",
