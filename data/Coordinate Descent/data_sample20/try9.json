If we encounter a point x where f(x) achieves its minimum along each of the coordinate axes, then x could represent a global minimizer. This indicates that for an expression of the form f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi), where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is convex as well, applying coordinate descent can help in locating a minimizer: begin with an initial guess x(0), and iteratively update as follows: for k = 1, 2, 3, ... set x(k)1 to be the argument minimizing f(x1, x(k\u22121)2, x(k\u22121)3, ..., x(k\u22121)n), then derive x(k)2 minimizing f(x(k)1, x2, x(k\u22121)3, ..., x(k\u22121)n), next obtain x(k)3 as the minimizer for f(x(k)1, x(k)2, x3, ..., x(k\u22121)n), and continue this process through to x(k)n minimizing f(x(k)1, x(k)2, x(k)3, ..., xn). Updates occur sequentially to incorporate the latest values for further minimization.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent for minimizing a differentiable convex function across multiple dimensions, highlighting how updates are made sequentially for each coordinate.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in minimizing a differentiable convex function. The goal is to clarify how each component of the process builds upon the previous updates and converge towards a global minimum. This visualization should illustrate the sequential nature of updates across multiple dimensions, emphasizing the relationship between the current and previous values at each step in the optimization process.\n\nI suggest using a flowchart combined with animated graphs that depict the function's surface and the trajectory of the coordinate descent. Each step in the process should be highlighted to show how changes in one coordinate influence the overall minimization. By integrating these visual elements, learners will clearly see the cause-effect relationships of each update and understand how they contribute to approaching the minimum efficiently.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will achieve a deep understanding of how coordinate descent operates iteratively to minimize a convex function, enabling them to visualize the convergence process and recognize the importance of each coordinate update in achieving optimal solutions.",
