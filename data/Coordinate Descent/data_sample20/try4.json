    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of Coordinate Descent for locating minima in a differentiable convex function by sequentially optimizing each coordinate.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent as it applies to finding the global minimum of a differentiable convex function. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how initial guesses are refined through sequential updates of each coordinate, ultimately leading to a global minimizer. Specifically, the visualization should clarify the relationships between the initial point, iterative updates, and finally achieving the minimum at each coordinate axis. A flowchart or step-by-step diagram could effectively represent this sequential process, showcasing each stage of the iteration and the updates as they progress toward convergence. This visual will not only enhance comprehension of the procedure but will also highlight the methodical nature of Coordinate Descent, emphasizing how each update contributes to the overall optimization.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of the Coordinate Descent algorithm, specifically how each iterative step influences the pathway toward finding the global minimum in a convex function, reinforcing their grasp of both the sequential nature of the updates and the significance of each coordinate's optimization in the process.",
