    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a quadratic function along a fixed coordinate, specifically highlighting the iterative approach of coordinate descent.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) with respect to the x variable, starting from the initial point (-1, -1) and moving along the fixed line at \\( y = -1 \\). This visualization should graphically represent the quadratic function in a 3D surface plot, clearly showing the function's contours and a line indicating the fixed y-value. Overlay this with markers indicating the initial coordinates and the subsequent points after each iteration of minimizing \\( x \\). Additionally, include annotations to clarify how the function\u2019s minimum is approached through coordinate descent. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate the concept of optimizing functions along a specific direction while emphasizing the iterative nature of the process. By visualizing the relationships between the coordinates, the trajectory of the iterations, and the absolute minimum of the function, learners can better understand how coordinate descent works and how it progresses towards the function's minimum through constrained movement along axes.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will grasp the nature of quadratic functions and coordinate optimization by visually connecting the iterative process of coordinate descent with tangible shifts in the function's value, leading to a deeper understanding of optimization strategies in multivariable calculus. The visualization will help them internalize the cause-effect relationships and the sequential steps involved in reaching the quadratic function\u2019s minimum.",
