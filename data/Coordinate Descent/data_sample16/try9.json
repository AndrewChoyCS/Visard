    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The process of minimizing a quadratic function using coordinate descent, specifically focusing on the iterative approach to find the minimum by varying one variable while keeping the other fixed.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy\\) using coordinate descent starting from the initial point (-1, -1). The visualization should illustrate the function's shape in three dimensions, highlighting the horizontal line at \\(y = -1\\) where we examine the function's behavior concerning \\(x\\). It should also depict how the function value changes as \\(x\\) is varied, and include markers for the iterations made towards finding the minimum along this line. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the concept of coordinate descent, specifically how fixing one variable allows for easier identification of minima in a multidimensional context. Utilize a 3D surface plot to depict the quadratic function, along with an overlay of the line graph at \\(y = -1\\) for \\(x\\) values, clearly showing the shifts in function values during iterations. This visual approach will aid understanding by highlighting the relationship between the function's surface and the lines along which minimization is performed, enhancing comprehension of the iterative nature of the process.\n\n**Educational Outcome Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of coordinate descent by visualizing how fixing one variable simplifies the process of finding minima in a quadratic function, thereby fostering insights into the optimization strategies used in multidimensional analysis. Through this visualization, learners will grasp the cause-effect relationships inherent in the iterative process, recognizing the importance of sequential evaluation of variables and their impact on the overall function.",
