    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a quadratic function using Coordinate Descent, specifically illustrating the concept of fixing one variable while optimizing another.\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) by fixing \\( y \\) at a constant value (in this case, \\( y = -1 \\)) and focusing on the minimization with respect to \\( x \\). The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how the function behaves as we iteratively adjust \\( x \\) while \\( y \\) remains constant, showcasing the progression toward the minimum point on the function's graph. \n\nUse a combination of 2D contour plots to represent the original function and a separate line graph for the unidimensional function formed by fixing \\( y \\) at -1. This will clarify the relationships between \\( x \\) and \\( f(x, -1) \\), demonstrate the concept of finding local minima, and emphasize the iterative nature of the Coordinate Descent method.\n\nBy integrating before-and-after snapshots of the trajectory taken during the minimization process, the visualization will help learners better understand the sequential steps required in the algorithm, facilitate recognition of cause-effect relationships in optimization, and highlight the hierarchical structure inherent in the function landscape. \n\n**Objective:** Develop a deep understanding of how fixing one variable affects the optimization process of a multi-variable function and the iterative nature of Coordinate Descent in locating minima in parameter spaces.",
