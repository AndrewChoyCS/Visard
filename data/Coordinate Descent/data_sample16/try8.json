    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a multivariable quadratic function involves iteratively adjusting one variable at a time while keeping others fixed, illustrating the concept of Coordinate Descent.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) starting from the initial point (-1, -1). The goal of the visualization is to depict how fixing the \\( y \\) variable at -1 allows us to derive a unidimensional quadratic function in \\( x \\) and how successive iterations (showcasing different \\( x \\) values) converge towards the function's minimum. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the fixed input and output values as well as demonstrate the iterative nature of the Coordinate Descent method. \n\nThe recommended visualization style is a combination of a line graph (showing the quadratic function in one dimension) and a 3D surface plot (illustrating the entire function \\( f(x, y) \\)). Highlighting the trajectories of the iterations will make the sequences and progress of the optimization clear. This visual aids understanding by illustrating the effects of varying one variable while keeping others constant, emphasizing cause-effect relationships as learners observe how each iteration progresses toward the function's minimum.\n\n**Objective:** By engaging with this visualization, learners will deeply understand the principle of Coordinate Descent through clear examples of how variable adjustments impact function minimization, leading to a comprehensive grasp of the concept\u2019s application in optimization problems.",
