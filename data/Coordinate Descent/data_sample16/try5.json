    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe principle of minimizing a quadratic function along a fixed coordinate axis, specifically illustrating the process of optimizing one variable while holding another constant.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) along the line defined by \\( y = -1 \\). The goal is to visually illustrate how fixing \\( y \\) at -1 transforms the two-dimensional function into a one-dimensional quadratic function in \\( x \\). This visualization should clarify how successive iterations can move toward the minimum value on this line, highlighting the relationship between the fixed y-coordinate and the behavior of the quadratic function. \n\nUtilize a combination of graphs and diagrams, possibly an infographic style, to show the original 3D surface of the quadratic function, alongside the 2D cross-section at \\( y = -1 \\). Label the critical points, iterations, and the minimum found, while also indicating the constraints associated with moving along the coordinate axes. This visual will aid in understanding the sequential process of coordinate descent and its effect on finding the local minimum.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\nLearners should be able to visualize and comprehend the steps involved in optimizing a variable while holding another constant, grasping the concept of coordinate descent as integral to function minimization. The visualization will deepen their understanding of quadratic functions, how they behave in multi-dimensional spaces, and the significance of iterations in reaching functional minima.",
