    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe process of optimizing a quadratic function using Coordinate Descent by fixing one variable and minimizing the function with respect to the other variable along that line.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the optimization process of the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) at the initial point (-1, -1) while minimizing with respect to \\( x \\) by fixing \\( y \\) at -1. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how this process translates into finding minimum points along a horizontal line at \\( y = -1 \\) and emphasize the iterative nature of this method. It should clarify the relationship between fixed variables and the effect of changing one variable on the function's value, showcasing the quadratic nature of the one-dimensional function obtained. \n\nThe visualization should adopt a diagrammatic style, including a 3D surface plot of the function, a horizontal line representing \\( y = -1 \\), and circles or markers indicating the initial point, the first iteration, and the subsequent positions in the optimization process. This visual will aid in conceptualizing the sequential steps involved in the Coordinate Descent method, highlighting cause-effect relationships as the coordinates change and the function approaches its minimum.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nStudents will achieve a deep understanding of the Coordinate Descent optimization process by visualizing how fixing one variable influences the function\u2019s landscape, thereby enabling clearer grasp of the iterative minimization and effectively demonstrating the relationships between the variables and their impact on the function's value.",
