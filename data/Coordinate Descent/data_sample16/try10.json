    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing a multivariable quadratic function using Coordinate Descent, particularly focusing on the impact of fixing one variable while optimizing another.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) using Coordinate Descent. The goal is to illustrate how fixing the variable \\( y \\) at -1 allows us to analyze the unidimensional function along the x-axis, highlighting the iterative steps taken to approach the function's minimum. This should clarify the concept of how variable fixation affects the trajectory of optimization and the significance of each iteration in narrowing down the search for the minimum.\n\nThe visualization should incorporate a graph that depicts the 3D surface of the function with a clear horizontal plane at \\( y = -1 \\). Along this plane, overlay the quadratic curve representing the optimized function and annotate the points of iteration to show progress towards the minimum. Use contrasting colors to differentiate between the surface plot, the fixed line at \\( y = -1 \\), and the iterations.\n\nThis visual aid supports understanding of relationships involved in Coordinate Descent, allowing learners to compare the original function's behavior and visualize the sequential approach to finding the minimum. By emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships within the optimization process and showcasing the iteration steps, the visualization will deepen the learner\u2019s insight into the mechanism of Coordinate Descent.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a robust understanding of how fixing one variable in a multivariable function influences the minimization process, emphasizing the role of iteration in progressing toward an optimal solution.",
