    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The process of minimizing a quadratic function using coordinate descent, emphasizing the importance of fixing one variable and exploring the resulting unidimensional function.**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) through coordinate descent, starting at the initial point (-1, -1) and focusing on how fixing the y variable (specifically at \\( y = -1 \\)) transforms the original equation into a unidimensional function. The visualization should depict a 3D graph representing the function, with a highlighted horizontal plane at \\( y = -1 \\) showing the unidimensional curve in the x-y plane, where the minimum value occurs. Additionally, illustrate the two iterations of adjusting the x variable to demonstrate progress toward the function\u2019s minimum.\n\nThis visualization aims to clarify the critical steps in coordinate descent, highlighting the relationship between fixing one variable and analyzing the resulting impact on the function's minimum. By showcasing sequential iterations, learners will perceive how local adjustments can lead toward a global minimum. Suggested styles include a 3D surface plot combined with a 2D cross-section overlay, facilitating a comparative analysis of the function's values while emphasizing the movement along the coordinate axes.\n\n**Objective:** Enable learners to grasp the principles of coordinate descent by visually linking the process of fixing variables and navigating a quadratic function towards its minimum, thereby fostering a deep understanding of optimization techniques in multivariable calculus.",
