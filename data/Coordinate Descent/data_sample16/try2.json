    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a multivariable quadratic function through coordinate descent, specifically focusing on how fixing one variable while minimizing with respect to another provides a systematic approach to finding the function's minimum.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) using coordinate descent, focusing on the iterative process of fixing \\( y \\) and finding the minimum along a horizontal line (at \\( y = -1 \\)). The visualization should include a 3D surface plot of the function, highlighting the horizontal line at \\( y = -1 \\) and the corresponding 2D quadratic function generated from this fix. This will clarify the concept of reducing the problem from a two-dimensional surface to a one-dimensional optimization along the specified line. Key educational outcomes should include understanding the iterative nature of coordinate descent, how fixing one variable simplifies the optimization problem, and visualizing the progression toward the function's minimum. Using a combination of surface plots, line graphs, and annotation will effectively illustrate the relationships and steps in the process, aligning with instructional best practices by emphasizing the sequential actions taken through the coordinate descent method. \n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand the iterative nature of coordinate descent as a method of moving towards function minimization, by visualizing the transition from a multidimensional problem to a unidimensional solution space.",
