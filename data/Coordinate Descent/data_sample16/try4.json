    "data": "Consider a straightforward quadratic function, f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. We start our analysis at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) and embark on minimizing the function with respect to the x variable. By labeling a horizontal line at y = -1 (keeping y fixed), we can determine the minimum value along this line related to y = -1. Since f is a quadratic expression, the unidimensional function found by fixing y at -1 is also of quadratic nature. Through two iterations, we clearly see that we've made significant strides towards finding the function\u2019s minimum, yet there remains a journey ahead, constrained by motion along the coordinate axes.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a quadratic function through sequential optimization along the coordinate axes, specifically illustrating the effects of fixing one variable while optimizing another.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) by holding \\( y \\) constant at -1 and optimizing \\( x \\). The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how the function behaves in a two-dimensional space and how fixing one variable simplifies the optimization process. The visualization should involve a 3D surface plot of the function, along with a projection of the curve obtained by fixing \\( y = -1 \\) as a separate 2D graph, emphasizing the minimum value along that line.\n\nThe specific concept this visualization intends to clarify is the quadratic nature of the function and the sequential steps taken in coordinate descent. Key educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deeper understanding of how fixing a variable influences the optimization of another variable and how the overall minimum of the function can be approached iteratively.\n\nTo enhance learning, the visualization should employ a combination of illustrative 3D graphs with dynamic overlays showing movements in the \\( x \\) direction, alongside annotations that highlight the minimum point on the 2D curve. This multi-layered approach helps learners grasp relationships between trajectory, minimum values, and the iterative nature of the coordinate descent method, ultimately solidifying their understanding of the minimization process. \n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to analyze and interpret the relationship between variable fixation and optimization in quadratic functions, applying this understanding to sequential decision-making processes in coordinate descent.",
