    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe core principle that can be visualized is the process of coordinate descent in minimizing a quadratic function by iteratively optimizing along one dimension at a time.\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent as applied to the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) starting from the initial point \\( (-1, -1) \\). The goal is to illustrate how the minimization progresses along the x-dimension while holding the y-value constant at \\( y = -1 \\). This visualization should highlight the relationship between the original two-dimensional quadratic function and the one-dimensional quadratic function obtained at \\( y = -1 \\). \n\nThe visual could include a 3D surface plot of the function with a 2D slice (transect) at \\( y = -1 \\) to show the computational pathway taken during the coordinate descent process. Include markers for the initial point, interim points after iterations, and the direction of movement along the x-axis.\n\nThis approach deepens understanding by clearly presenting the sequential process of minimizing the function, revealing how each iteration brings the solution closer to the overall minimum. The use of contrasting colors to differentiate between dimensions and movement can enhance visual comprehension and engagement.\n\n### Objective\nStudents will achieve a deep understanding of coordinate descent by clearly visualizing how one-dimensional optimization works within the context of multidimensional functions, helping them grasp the mechanics of finding minima in a structured, stepwise fashion.",
