    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extraction:** The iterative process of minimizing a function using coordinate descent, specifically demonstrating how one navigates along coordinate axes and the effect of holding variables constant to find local minima.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent as applied to the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) with an initial point at \\((-1, -1)\\). The goal is to illustrate the concept of minimizing the function along one coordinate axis (the x-dimension in this case) while holding the other variable (y) constant. By visually representing the quadratic landscape of the function, including transects along the held constant level, we can effectively show how each iteration brings the solution closer to the minimum point. \n\nUtilize a 3D surface plot to depict the function, complemented with a 2D cross-section (transect) at \\( y = -1 \\) to highlight how the one-dimensional optimization progresses over iterations. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the variables and how the iterative nature of the coordinate descent method works, aiming for key educational outcomes in understanding that optimization depends on directionality and variable fixation. \n\n**Objective:** To ensure learners grasp the significance of coordinate descent by observing the relationship between iterations, where iterative adjustments in one dimension lead to improved approximation of the minimum, thereby deepening their insight into multi-variable optimization techniques.",
