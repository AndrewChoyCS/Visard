    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing a quadratic function using coordinate descent, illustrating the hold-along-axis strategy.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent applied to the quadratic function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, starting from the initial point (-1, -1). The goal is to illustrate how the minimization proceeds along the coordinate axes, specifically highlighting the minimization along the x-axis while keeping y constant at -1. The visual should clearly depict the function's contours, the transect at y = -1, and the movement towards the minimum at each iteration. This could include a series of graphs or an animated plot showing how each step brings the current point closer to the function's minimum while adhering to the constraints of movement along the axes.\n\nThe key educational outcomes expected from this visualization are:\n1. **Understanding Iterative Processes:** Students will grasp how iterative minimization works in multidimensional optimization, specifically through coordinate descent.\n2. **Visualizing Function Relationships:** By illustrating the contour of the function alongside the transect, students can see the effect of holding one variable constant on the other and the nature of quadratic functions in one and two dimensions.\n3. **Recognizing Limitations:** The visualization should educate learners about the constraints of coordinate descent, emphasizing that it only moves towards the minimum along the coordinate axes, which can lead to suboptimal paths.\n\nThis visual representation will aid in understanding the fundamental principle of minimizing functions through coordinate descent by clearly showing the relationships and sequences involved in the process, thus fostering a deeper comprehension of this optimization technique. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to describe and illustrate the process of coordinate descent in minimizing a quadratic function, recognizing the implications of axis-aligned optimization and its effect on convergence toward the function's minimum.",
