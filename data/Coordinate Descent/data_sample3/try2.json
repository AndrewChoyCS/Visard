    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extracted:\nThe iterative process of coordinate descent on a quadratic function, focusing on minimizing along one dimension while holding the other dimension constant.\n\n### Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent applied to the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) starting from the initial point \\((-1, -1)\\). The visualization should illustrate how the minimization along the x-dimension, while holding y constant at -1, leads us closer to the overall minimum of the function. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the two-dimensional function and its one-dimensional transect, emphasizing how each iteration on the x-axis affects the overall minimization process. This can be visualized using a combination of 3D surface plots to show the function, a 2D line plot to represent the transect at \\( y = -1 \\), and arrows to indicate the iterative movements toward the minimum. \n\nKey educational outcomes expected include understanding the sequential process of coordinate descent, recognizing the influence of holding one variable constant during optimization, and visualizing the convergence towards the minimum. This visualization should effectively highlight the cause-and-effect relationships between each iteration\u2019s impact on the function\u2019s value, enhancing the learner\u2019s insight into the coordinate descent method.\n\n### Objective:\nTo develop a deep understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent in optimization, focusing on how manipulating one variable while holding another constant affects convergence to the function\u2019s minimum.",
