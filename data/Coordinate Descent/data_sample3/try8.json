    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\nThe principle of \"minimization along coordinate axes in coordinate descent\" using a quadratic function, highlighting how iterative adjustments are made in a structured manner, affects convergence toward the minimum of the function.\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent applied to a quadratic function, specifically the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy.** The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the algorithm progresses toward the function's minimum by taking steps along the x-axis while keeping y constant. The key concept to clarify is the iterative nature of this approach, emphasizing the importance of holding one variable constant while adjusting the other as a means of convergence.\n\nThe visualization should integrate a **2D contour plot** of the function showing level curves (or contours) and an arrow or path indicating the initial point at (-1, -1) and subsequent positions after each iteration along the x-axis, while maintaining a fixed y value. Additionally, including a graphical representation of a transect line at y = -1 will enhance understanding of how adjustments are made only in one dimension at a time. This approach highlights the sequential process of coordinate descent, making it clear how decisions at each step are influenced by the current position on the contour plot.\n\n### Educational Objective:\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will gain a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method, recognizing how iterative adjustments along one variable can lead to convergence to a minimum in a systematic manner. This comprehension will foster a more nuanced grasp of optimization techniques in multivariable functions, grounding their knowledge in practical application as well as theoretical understanding.",
