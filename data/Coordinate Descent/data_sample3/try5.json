    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of minimizing a function using coordinate descent by successively optimizing along one dimension while holding other dimensions constant.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent applied to the function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\), specifically highlighting the first two iterations starting from the initial point \\((-1, -1)\\). The goal is to illustrate how fixing one variable at a time (in this case, \\(y = -1\\) while minimizing with respect to \\(x\\)) allows for successive approximation of the minimum of a multivariable function. Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of the convergence process and the significance of the quadratic shape in this optimization pathway. \n\nThe visualization should incorporate a 3D surface plot of the function \\( f(x, y) \\) alongside 2D cross-sections at \\(y = -1\\), showcasing both iterations with marked points indicating the progress toward the minimum. Using clear labels and colors to distinguish between the iterations, this diagram will emphasize the relationship between coordinates, the effect of fixing dimensions, and how each step moves closer to the overall minimum.\n\n**Objective**: To enable learners to deeply understand the concept of coordinate descent as a sequential optimization method, focusing on the importance of iteratively fixing variables to effectively navigate a multivariable landscape towards finding global minima.",
