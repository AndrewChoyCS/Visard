    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle:\n**The iterative process of coordinate descent for minimizing a quadratic function by moving along one dimension at a time.**\n\n---\n\n### Visualization Query:\nCreate a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent using the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) starting from the initial point \\( (-1, -1) \\). The goal is to illustrate how minimization is executed iteratively along the x-dimension while holding y constant. The specific concept intended to be clarified is the method of finding a minimum along a transect in a multi-dimensional space and how this leads gradually to the overall minimum of the function. \n\nThe visualization should include a 3D plot of the quadratic function, highlighting the initial point, the transect line at \\( y = -1 \\), and the changes in position after each iteration. Use arrows to indicate the direction of movement along the x-axis, and label important points such as the minimum value reached at each iteration. An infographic style would be effective here, combining 3D graphs with callouts and annotations for clarity.\n\nBy visualizing both the quadratic surface and the iterations of the coordinate descent, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between coordinate movement, function values, and the convergence towards the minimum.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objective:\nStudents will be able to analyze and describe the iterative nature of coordinate descent by visually tracking how each step along a specific coordinate direction leads to a gradual approach to the function's global minimum, reinforcing the concept of optimization in multivariable spaces.",
