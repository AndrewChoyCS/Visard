    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The process of coordinate descent involves iteratively minimizing a function by alternating optimization along one coordinate axis while holding the other(s) constant, exemplified by the function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\).\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the concept of coordinate descent using the function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\) and the initial point \\( (-1, -1) \\). The goal is to illustrate how minimization progresses in a two-dimensional space by showing the impact of optimizing along the x-axis while keeping y constant. Highlight the relationship between the two-dimensional function and the derived one-dimensional function along the transect at \\( y = -1 \\) to clarify how each iteration brings the solution closer to the minimum. \n\nIncorporate a series of two-dimensional contour plots or a dynamic graph that depicts the function's surface and the current position at each iteration, along with arrows indicating movement along the coordinate axes. Use annotations to reveal the corresponding changes in function values as the minimization progresses. \n\nThis visual should deepen understanding of the iterative process in coordinate descent, emphasizing cause-effect relationships of each decision point and showing the sequential nature of approaching the optimal solution. \n\n**Objective**: The learner should grasp how coordinate descent operates by understanding the iterative trajectory toward function minimization, recognizing the significance of each optimization step within the broader process, and appreciating how maintaining constant parameters can simplify the minimization of multi-dimensional functions.",
