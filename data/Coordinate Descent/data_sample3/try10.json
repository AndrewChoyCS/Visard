    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** Understanding coordinate descent through iterative minimization along coordinate axes using a quadratic function.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent algorithm applied to the function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\), starting from the initial point \\((-1, -1)\\). The goal is to visually represent how the minimization occurs along the x-dimension while holding y constant at \\(-1\\) and how this process approaches the function's minimum through successive iterations. The visualization should depict both the original 2D quadratic surface and the 1D transect along \\( y = -1 \\), highlighting the points of iterative improvement. \n\nUse a combination of a 3D surface plot to represent the function and a separate 1D graph for the minimization along the specified transect. This should include labeled points indicating the initial position and subsequent iterations, which allow learners to grasp the sequential nature of the optimization process. \n\nBy making the iterative nature of the descent clear, this visualization will reinforce the understanding of how algorithmic choices impact optimization pathways and the importance of moving along coordinate axes, thereby aiding in achieving a deeper comprehension of coordinate descent.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to visualize and articulate the process of coordinate descent, recognizing how minimizing functions along specific dimensions can be achieved iteratively, and will understand the significance of these iterations in approaching the overall minimum of multivariate functions.",
