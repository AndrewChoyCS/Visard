    "data": "If we take a simple quadratic function we can take a detailed look at how coordinate descent works. Let\u2019s use the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 + x y . Let\u2019s take as our initial point  ( \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) and begin our minimization along the x dimension. We can draw a transect at the y = \u2212 1 level (thus holding y constant) and attempt to find the minimum along that transect. Because f is a quadratic function, the one-dimensional function induced by holding y = \u2212 1 is also a quadratic.We can see that after two iterations we are quite a bit closer to the minimum. But we still have a ways to go, given that we can only move along the coordinate axis directions.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle Extraction\nThe core principle to be visualized is the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a quadratic function, specifically how the optimization occurs along the coordinate axes and the resulting progression toward a minimum.\n\n### Visualization Query\n**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how coordinate descent works by showing its step-by-step iterations starting from the initial point (-1, -1), highlighting the minimization along the x-axis while holding y constant at -1. The visualization should include a 3D surface plot of the function alongside a 2D cross-section (transect) at y = -1, indicating how the x-minimization occurs and demonstrating the shifts in the function's values after each iteration. \n\nThis visualization should also clearly illustrate the relationship between the original multidimensional function and the resulting one-dimensional function derived by fixing y, emphasizing the sequential nature of the optimization process. An infographic style would be suitable, integrating color coding to show the initial point, iterated points, and the path taken towards the minimum.\n\n### Learning Objective\nThe objective is for learners to deeply understand the process of coordinate descent in multi-variable optimization, specifically how the algorithm moves along coordinate axes in search of a minimum, and to appreciate the implications of working within constrained dimensions in multi-dimensional optimization problems. Through this, learners will grasp the significance of each iteration in their convergence toward optimal solutions.",
