    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of minimizing an objective function along individual coordinate directions while keeping most components fixed, resulting in lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms in optimizing objective functions. The visualization should showcase the sequential process of fixing most elements of the variable vector \\( x \\) while iteratively adjusting the unchecked components within a lower-dimensional space. By illustrating this process through an infographic, highlighting the key steps in each iteration and the dimensional reduction of subproblems, learners will gain insights into how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization tasks. This visual should make the cause-effect relationships clear, demonstrating how fixing coordinates allows for more manageable problem-solving and clarify how each iteration leads to an improved solution. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of how coordinate descent operates through iterative minimization, emphasizing the significance of dimensionality reduction and the role of fixed versus variable components in optimization problems.",
