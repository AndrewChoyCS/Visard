    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms and their focus on minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions while keeping other variables fixed.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms in optimizing an objective function. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration focuses on individual coordinate directions\u2014showing fixed variables in one color, those being optimized in another, and how the objective function is reduced at each step. This visual should clarify the relationship between fixed and changing coordinates, demonstrating the progression through the optimization landscape. Incorporate elements like a 3D plot representing the objective function, sequential arrows to indicate iterations, and highlighted paths to show how each step leads to an improved solution.\n\nBy using a combination of diagrams and flowcharts, this visualization can deepen understanding by clearly showcasing the cause-and-effect relationships between interactions of fixed and modified components, reinforcing the sequential nature of the optimization process. \n\n**Objective:** To enable learners to grasp the core iterative mechanism of coordinate descent algorithms and its effectiveness in simplifying complex multidimensional optimization problems through the visualization of relationships and processes inherent in the method.",
