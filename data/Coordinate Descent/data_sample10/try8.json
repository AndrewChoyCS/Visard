    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of minimizing individual components of the optimization problem in Coordinate Descent algorithms.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimization problems, focusing on how individual components of the variable vector are adjusted while others remain fixed. The goal is to illustrate the relationship between fixed and variable components during optimization, as well as how each iteration simplifies the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems. This visualization should take the form of a flowchart that sequentially demonstrates the steps involved in the coordinate descent process, capturing the cause-effect relationships between iterations and the gradual convergence towards the optimal solution. \n\nBy clearly presenting these relationships, the visual will deepen learners' insights into the systematic nature of the coordinate descent method and highlight how complexity is reduced at each step. It will reinforce the understanding that while most variables are held constant, the adjustments to select components move the optimization closer to a solution, enhancing comprehension of iterative techniques in mathematical optimization.\n\n**Objective:** Achieve a fundamental and nuanced understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm by visualizing and solidifying learners' grasp of its iterative mechanics, ultimately resulting in a clearer familiarity with optimization processes in higher dimensions.",
