    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where optimization occurs along individual coordinate directions while keeping other variables fixed, leading to lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent algorithms in optimizing objective functions. The goal is to illustrate how the algorithm selectively minimizes the objective function along one coordinate direction at a time while other coordinates remain unchanged. This visualization should clarify the concept of lower-dimensional subproblems that arise from this iterative approach. \n\nUse a flowchart or a sequence diagram to depict the steps of the optimization process, emphasizing the isolation of individual coordinates and the iterative nature of the technique. Include elements to demonstrate cause-effect relationships between the fixed coordinates and how this leads to a simpler problem, as well as visual cues to indicate the reducing dimensionality of each subproblem. By focusing on these relationships and sequences, the visual will aid learners in grasping the mechanics and advantages of coordinate descent, fostering a deeper understanding of why this approach is effective for optimization tasks.\n\n**Objective**: By the end of this learning experience, students will be able to articulate how the iterative nature of coordinate descent allows for the simplification of complex optimization problems into manageable subproblems, enhancing their ability to apply this method in various computational scenarios.",
