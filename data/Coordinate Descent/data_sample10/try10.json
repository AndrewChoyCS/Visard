    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to be Visualized:** The process of iteratively minimizing an objective function in coordinate descent algorithms by focusing on one coordinate direction at a time, while keeping other coordinates fixed.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of minimizing an objective function in coordinate descent algorithms. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration targets a single coordinate (or hyperplane) while maintaining other coordinates at their previous values. This visual representation should clarify the relationship between the objective function and its subproblems, revealing how each subproblem simplifies the overall optimization challenge. A flowchart or diagram format would be effective for showcasing the sequences and transitions between iterations, highlighting key updates in the variable vector \\( x \\). By visualizing this process, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how lower-dimensional subproblems aid in efficiently reaching the optimization goal.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\n1. Deep understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent.\n2. Clarity on how fixing coordinates simplifies the optimization process.\n3. Insight into the relationship between the dimensionality of subproblems and the overall optimization challenge.",
