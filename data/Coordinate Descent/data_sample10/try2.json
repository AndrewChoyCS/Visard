    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The iterative minimization process in coordinate descent algorithms, wherein most variables remain fixed while certain components are adjusted.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms in optimizing a function. The goal is to illustrate how the variable vector \\( x \\) is adjusted step-by-step, emphasizing that certain coordinates are kept fixed while others are minimized. This visualization should clearly depict the relationships and sequences involved in each iteration, potentially using a flowchart or layered diagram to show how each iteration reduces the dimensionality of the problem. By representing the iterative adjustments visually, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate directions are handled, enhancing their grasp of how optimizations become progressively simpler through this strategic approach.\n\n**Educational Outcomes Expected:** Learners should be able to describe the process of coordinate descent, identify the roles of fixed versus updated coordinates in each iteration, and understand how this method simplifies complex optimization problems. The visual should highlight the sequence of operations and the concept of dimensionality reduction, facilitating a clearer recognition of the relationships between components in the optimization process.",
