    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing an objective function by fixing most variable components and focusing on a single coordinate direction.\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of the coordinate descent algorithm in optimizing objective functions. The visualization should illustrate how, during each iteration, the variable vector components remain mostly fixed while one coordinate is varied to minimize the objective function. This could be represented using a flowchart that visually depicts the iterative steps involved in the process, clearly labeling each component of the variable vector and highlighting the selected coordinate for optimization. Additionally, include a comparative analysis of a high-dimensional optimization problem versus its lower-dimensional subproblems tackled at each step. \n\nThis visual representation will help learners understand the relationships between fixed and variable components, the sequence of operations in each iteration, and how reduction in dimensionality leads to ease of optimization. By effectively conveying these elements, the visualization can foster a deep understanding of the coordinate descent approach, emphasizing its functionality and advantages in solving complex optimization problems. \n\n**Objective:** The goal is to develop a foundational understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm, enabling learners to grasp how iterative minimization works and its significance in simplifying high-dimensional optimization into more manageable subproblems. This understanding will support learners in applying these principles to real-life optimization tasks.",
