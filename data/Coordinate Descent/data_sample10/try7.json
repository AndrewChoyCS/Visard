    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of optimizing the objective function in coordinate descent algorithms by adjusting one variable at a time while keeping others fixed.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration focuses on minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions while keeping the other variables constant. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the variable vectors, the remaining fixed elements, and the lower-dimensional subproblems that emerge from this approach. A flowchart or diagram showing the sequential progression of iterations and the impact of fixing certain variables could effectively depict the cause-effect relationships inherent in the process. By visually representing this concept, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent simplifies complex problems, leading to improved insight into the broader implications of optimization techniques.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will be able to articulate the main steps in the coordinate descent process, identify the significance of variable fixation during iterations, and recognize how lower-dimensional subproblems facilitate easier problem resolution\u2014all critical for understanding advanced optimization strategies.",
