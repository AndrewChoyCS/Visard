    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where each component is optimized while others remain fixed, leading to simpler subproblems.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative optimization process of coordinate descent algorithms. The visualization should depict how each iteration focuses on minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions, while illustrating the fixed elements of the variable vector. Use a flowchart that shows the progression of iterations, highlighting which coordinates are optimized in each step and how the subproblems reduce in dimensionality. The goal is to clarify the relationships between the fixed and variable components in each iteration, thus enhancing the learner's understanding of how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization problems. By visually distinguishing fixed and flexible components, the visualization will reinforce the iterative nature and help learners grasp the efficiency and mechanics of solving higher-dimensional optimization challenges. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Deeply understand the operational mechanics of coordinate descent, focusing on recognizing how optimizing individual coordinates while keeping others constant leads to lower-dimensional and more manageable subproblems.",
