    "data": "Coordinate descent algorithms address optimization problems by iteratively minimizing the objective function along individual coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These methods are also classified as iterative techniques where, during each iteration, most elements of the variable vector x remain fixed at their values from the previous step, while the objective is approximately minimized for the unchecked components. Each resulting subproblem is of lower dimension (and can even be one-dimensional), making it generally easier to resolve than the entire optimization problem.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent algorithms, where most coordinates remain fixed while others are optimized to simplify the objective function.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative optimization process of coordinate descent algorithms. The goal is to illustrate how each iteration focuses on optimizing one coordinate while keeping the others constant, thereby gradually approaching a minimum of the objective function. This visualization should clarify the sequences of updates to the variable vector \\( x \\) and the dimensionality reduction associated with each subproblem. \n\nA flowchart or step-by-step diagram would be ideal for depicting the iterative steps, with arrows showing how one coordinate is adjusted while the others stay fixed. Additionally, consider including simple graphics of the objective function contour plots to visually represent the gradient and how these adjustments lead toward the minimum. This approach will deepen learners' understanding of the relationship between the fixed and optimized coordinates, the simplification of problems at each step, and the overarching iterative process that defines coordinate descent.\n\n**Learning Objective:** To ensure learners can clearly conceptualize and articulate how coordinate descent algorithms iteratively refine their solutions through selective optimization of dimensions, enhancing their grasp on iterative optimization techniques and their practical applications in optimization problems.",
