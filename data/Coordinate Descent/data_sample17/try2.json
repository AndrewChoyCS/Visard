    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative refinement process in coordinate descent leads to finding a global minimizer of a convex, differentiable function.\n\n---\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative refinement process in coordinate descent for global minimization of a convex and differentiable function. The goal is to clarify how the procedure converges to a global minimum by illustrating the relationship between successive iterations and dimensions of the input space. \n\nThe visualization should include a multi-dimensional graph that shows the initial guess, the trajectory of successive guesses, and the point where the function achieves its global minimum. Utilize a series of layered graphs or a flowchart style to depict the sequential nature of optimizing each coordinate while holding others constant, highlighting cause-effect relationships throughout the iterations. \n\nBy representing this process visually, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent systematically explores the function space, ultimately demonstrating the convergence to the optimal solution through clear visual sequences of progression and refinement. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Understand the iterative optimization process in coordinate descent, emphasizing the relationship between coordinates and global minimization through function evaluation and progression toward the minimum.",
