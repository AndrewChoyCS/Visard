    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle: Global Minimization through Coordinate Descent\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of finding a global minimizer in a convex and differentiable function using coordinate descent. The visualization should illustrate the iterative process of refining an initial guess, highlighting how each step involves minimizing the function with respect to one coordinate at a time while keeping the others constant. Use a sequence of graphs that show the progression from the initial point \\( x^{(0)} \\) to subsequent iterations \\( x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, \\ldots \\) and emphasize the points where the function achieves a minimum along each axis. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the relationship between the coordinates and their impact on the global minimizer, showcasing how each optimization step leads us closer to the optimal solution. By employing a flowchart style combined with plotted function contours, learners will be able to visualize both the direction of descent and the nature of the optimization landscape. \n\n### Expected Learning Outcomes:\n- Understand the process and benefits of using coordinate descent in optimization.\n- Identify the significance of convexity in ensuring a global minimum can be reached.\n- Visualize the sequential nature of coordinate descent, enhancing comprehension of cause-effect relationships between the optimization steps.\n\nThis visualization should facilitate deeper insights into the iterative refinement processes in coordinate descent and solidify learners' understanding of optimization in a geometric context.",
