    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The process of iteratively refining coordinates in coordinate descent to find a global minimizer for convex and differentiable functions.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent used to find a global minimizer for convex functions. The goal of this visualization is to depict how each coordinate is optimized in sequence while other coordinates remain fixed at their previous values, leading to overall convergence to a minimum point. The visualization should clarify the relationships between the function's values at different coordinates, the concept of holding other variables constant, and the sequential nature of the optimization process. A flowchart or diagram that illustrates each iteration step\u2014starting from an initial guess to subsequent optimizations for each coordinate\u2014would effectively highlight these concepts. \n\nBy integrating graphical elements like arrows to indicate the direction of the optimization, labels to denote specific coordinates being optimized, and distinct sections for each iteration, the visual aids in comprehending the systematic approach of the coordinate descent method. \n\n**Learning Objective**: Students will develop a deep understanding of how coordinate descent operates by visualizing the sequential refinement of variable coordinates, ultimately culminating in the identification of a global minimizer for convex functions.",
