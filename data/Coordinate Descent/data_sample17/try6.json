    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of finding a global minimizer in a convex function using coordinate descent, emphasizing the sequential adjustments of variables while holding others constant.\n\n**Visualization Query:** Create a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent for minimizing a convex function \\( f: R^n \\to R \\). The goal is to illustrate how an initial guess \\( x^{(0)} \\) is refined through a series of iterations, where each variable \\( x_i \\) is minimized one at a time while keeping the others constant. This visual should clearly depict the step-by-step adjustments of each coordinate in relation to the function\u2019s contours, highlighting how each iteration brings the overall solution closer to the global minimum. \n\nThe visualization could take the form of a flowchart combined with contour plots, showcasing the relationships and dependencies of the coordinates throughout the optimization process. By incorporating arrows to indicate the iterative improvements and changes, learners will gain insight into how each variable's minimization influences the overall function and the progression toward the global minima. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Achieve a deep understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm by illustrating how sequential refinement of variables leads to convergence towards a global minimizer, reinforcing key concepts in optimization and convex analysis.",
