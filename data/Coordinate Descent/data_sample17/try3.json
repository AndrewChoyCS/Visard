    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a convex and differentiable function, particularly the sequential updates of variables while holding others constant to identify a global minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in finding the global minimizer of a convex function.** \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to illustrate the sequential updates of each variable in the optimization process, highlighting how each step refines the solution towards the global minimum. The visualization should clarify the relationships between the initial guess, the variable updates, and the convergence to the minimizer, while depicting the function landscape with contours representing function values. A flowchart style could be used to demonstrate the structured sequence of updating each coordinate, interspersed with graphs showing the function's behavior at each step. \n\nBy employing a combination of diagrams and contour plots, the visual will deepen understanding by showcasing how holding certain coordinates constant while minimizing others impacts the overall optimization process. This approach will enable learners to see the cause-effect relationships between the individual coordinate updates and their cumulative effect on reducing the function value.\n\n**Objective:** Examine how the iterative updates in coordinate descent lead to convergence towards a global minimum of a convex function, allowing learners to visualize and engage with the optimization process effectively.",
