    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:**\nThe iterative process of coordinate descent in minimizing a convex and differentiable function by optimizing one coordinate at a time while holding others constant.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent for minimizing a convex function. The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how each coordinate is adjusted sequentially to approach the global minimum of a function in multiple dimensions. Specifically, the visualization should clarify the concept of holding certain coordinates constant while adjusting others, highlighting the relationships and sequences of adjustments in this optimization process. A flowchart or layered diagram would be appropriate to represent the iterative steps, where each layer shows the minimization of one coordinate and the resulting updated values for subsequent iterations. This visual will aid learners in comprehending the progression towards convergence on the global minimizer and the cause-effect relationship between singular coordinate adjustments and the overall function value.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nThe objective is to ensure that learners develop a deep understanding of the coordinate descent method, focusing on how sequential adjustments along individual axes lead to collective movement toward a global minimum in a convex optimization landscape. This includes grasping the importance of keeping other dimensions constant during each individual optimization step and how this structured approach facilitates efficient convergence.",
