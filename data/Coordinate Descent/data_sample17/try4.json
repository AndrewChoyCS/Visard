    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent as a method to identify global minima in a convex function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a convex function. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how an initial guess \\( x^{(0)} \\) is refined through successive steps by minimizing the function along each coordinate axis while holding other variables constant. This will clarify not only the step-by-step nature of the algorithm but also the relationship between iterations and convergence towards the global minimum. \n\nThe visualization should use a combination of an animated flowchart and graphical plots that represent the function's contours\u2014showing how each coordinate is adjusted until convergence. Key educational outcomes should include a clear understanding of the sequence of minimization steps, the significance of convexity in ensuring global minima, and the cause-effect relationship between each iteration and the progression toward the minimum.\n\nBy highlighting these aspects, the visual will enable learners to grasp the concept of coordinate descent as a structured, iterative optimization process, deepening their comprehension of both the mechanics and underlying principles of the method.",
