    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "### Core Principle: The Iterative Refinement Process of Coordinate Descent\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative refinement process of coordinate descent applied to a convex and differentiable function. The goal of the visualization is to clarify how starting from an initial guess can lead to a global minimizer by sequentially optimizing each coordinate while holding others constant. The visual should effectively illustrate the relationships between the iterations\u2014showing how each coordinate update builds upon the previous values and converges towards the global minimum. \n\nTo achieve this, an infographic style could be utilized, incorporating a 3D plot to represent the function\u2019s surface and clearly indicating the series of points (x^(k)) resulting from each coordinate optimization step. Additionally, arrows can show the progression through different coordinates and how they influence the overall function value. This visual will deepen learners' understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent and its mechanisms, enabling them to grasp the concept of convergence in optimization.\n\n### Learning Objective:\nStudents will be able to articulate the iterative refinement process of coordinate descent, understand its application to convex functions, and analyze the cause-effect relationships between successive iterations and the convergence to a global minimum.",
