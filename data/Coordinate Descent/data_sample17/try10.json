    "data": "Consider a function f: R^n \u2192 R that is both convex and differentiable. If we observe a point x where f(x) achieves a minimum along every axis in the coordinate system, it implies that we have identified a global minimizer. This observation lends strong support to using coordinate descent to ascertain a minimizer for functions like f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable and each hi is also convex). The procedure would be to commence with an initial guess, x^(0), and then iteratively refine the values: for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., we find x^(k)1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding the other coordinates constant at their previous iteration values x^(k-1)2, x^(k-1)3, ... x^(k-1)n. Next, we repeat for the remaining coordinates consecutively: x^(k)2 from the minimization w.r.t x2, x^(k)3 from the w.r.t. x3, and so forth up to x^(k)n, maintaining the chosen coordinates throughout the series of numerical optimizations.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of refining the minimization of a convex function using coordinate descent, demonstrating the importance of local optimization along each coordinate axis to reach a global minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in minimizing a convex function. The goal is to clearly illustrate how the function is optimized by sequentially adjusting one coordinate at a time while keeping others constant. The specific concept to clarify is the step-by-step progression of updates to the coordinates, portraying how this method leads to finding the global minimizer. \n\nFor the visualization style, consider using a series of diagrams that show the function's contours overlaid with points representing the iterative updates, along with arrows indicating the direction of each update. Each diagram can depict the function at different iterations (x^(0), x^(1), ..., x^(k)) to demonstrate the convergence towards the global minimum. This visual should emphasize the relationships between the coordinates and their updates throughout the process.\n\nThe educational outcomes expected from this visualization include the ability to grasp the sequential nature of coordinate descent, an understanding of how each update contributes to minimizing a convex function, and recognition of the importance of local optimization leading to a global solution. By following this structured approach, learners will gain a deep and crucial understanding of the fundamental mechanics behind the coordinate descent algorithm.",
