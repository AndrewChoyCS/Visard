    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of fixing variable components to simplify the optimization problem in coordinate descent methods.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how the algorithm progressively fixes certain elements of the variable vector while minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining components. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the iterative steps, the current state of the variable vector, and the resulting subproblems, specifically focusing on the transition from a high-dimensional problem to simpler, lower-dimensional tasks. \n\nConsider using a flowchart or a series of diagrams that depict each iteration, highlighting fixed variable components and the optimization process of the unfixed dimensions. The visual should also emphasize the cause-effect relationships of each step, enabling learners to see how fixing variables leads to simpler subproblems and ultimately contributes to finding the overall solution. \n\n**Educational Outcome:** This visualization aims to deepen the learner's understanding of how coordinate descent methods break down complex optimization tasks into manageable parts, reinforcing the concept of iterative problem-solving in a clear and intuitive manner.",
