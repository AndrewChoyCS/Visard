    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative process of fixing certain variables while minimizing the objective function with respect to others in coordinate descent methods.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent in optimization problems. The goal is to illustrate how, at each iteration, certain components of the variable vector \\( x \\) are held constant while minimizing the objective function with respect to the remaining variables. The visualization should clarify the relationships among the fixed and variable components, emphasizing the transition from a high-dimensional problem to lower-dimensional subproblems. An infographic or flowchart style would be effective, highlighting the sequential steps of the procedure and the simplification of each subproblem. This approach will deepen learners\u2019 understanding by clearly demonstrating cause-effect relationships in the optimization process, and showcasing how fixing variables alters the landscape of the optimization problem.\n\n**Learning Objective**: To ensure learners grasp how coordinate descent simplifies complex optimization tasks by iteratively breaking them down into more manageable subproblems, thereby fostering a clear understanding of the relationships between fixed and variable components at each step.",
