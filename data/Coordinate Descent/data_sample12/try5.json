    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent, where certain elements of the variable vector are fixed to simplify minimization tasks across lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent methods and how they simplify optimization problems through incremental adjustments. The goal of this visualization is to depict the sequential fixation of certain components of the variable vector \\( x \\), resulting in easier subproblems that lead to a final solution. This visualization should clarify the concept of transforming a complex, multidimensional problem into a series of simpler, lower-dimensional tasks by illustrating the relationships among variable components and their fixed or varied states. \n\nSuggested visualization styles include a flowchart to represent the iterative process, layered diagrams to show the transition from a high-dimensional to lower-dimensional tasks, and infographics to demonstrate the relationships and dependencies among different components. By utilizing these styles, the visual will enhance the understanding of the function of each component in the context of the entire optimization process, showcasing the cause-effect relationships and sequential steps involved in coordinate descent methods.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of how coordinate descent transforms complex optimization problems into manageable tasks, allowing learners to appreciate the effective breakdown of dimensions and the importance of each iterative step in reaching a final optimized solution.",
