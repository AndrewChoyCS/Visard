    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative nature of coordinate descent methods in optimization, where subproblems become simpler components of the overall task through fixing variables.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent methods in optimization. The goal is to illustrate how the method simplifies a complex optimization problem into lower-dimensional subproblems by fixing certain variables while adjusting others. This visualization should clarify the sequential relationship between iterations and the transformation of the variable vector \\( x \\), highlighting how each iteration leads to progress toward the global minimum. A flowchart or diagram style would effectively convey the step-by-step process and show the relationships between the fixed and variable components at each stage. By visualizing this concept, learners will be able to grasp the complexity reduction inherent in coordinate descent and understand how it leads to efficient optimization.\n\n**Objective:** To achieve a deep understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent, focusing on how fixing certain variables while minimizing others creates accessible subproblems, ultimately enhancing the learner\u2019s ability to implement and analyze optimization techniques in various contexts.",
