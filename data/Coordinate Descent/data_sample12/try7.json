    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of fixing some variables in the coordinate descent method to simplify the optimization task, resulting in lower-dimensional subproblems.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process involved in coordinate descent methods. The goal is to illustrate how the fixed variables lead to simpler optimization subproblems, showcasing the progression from a higher-dimensional challenge to lower-dimensional tasks. This visualization should clarify the relationship between the original optimization problem and its iterative refinements, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship of fixing variables. Suggested styles include a flowchart to depict the sequential nature of the iterations and a diagram to represent the dimensionality reduction at each step. This visual will facilitate a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent operates, making the complexities of the method more accessible and intuitively graspable.\n\n**Objective:** To enable learners to comprehend and articulate the iterative nature and simplification strategy of coordinate descent methods, reinforcing understanding through the visualization of key relationships and processes involved in reaching optimal solutions.",
