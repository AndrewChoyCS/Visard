    "data": "Coordinate descent methods are techniques for solving optimization problems that involve incremental minimization in coordinate directions or hyperplanes. These iterative procedures generate new solutions by fixing several elements of the variable vector x at their current iteration values, while focusing on minimizing the objective function with respect to the other components. Each resulting subproblem becomes a simpler, lower-dimensional (and often scalar) minimization task that can be addressed more easily than the comprehensive problem itself.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of fixing certain variables while optimizing others to simplify complex optimization problems in coordinate descent methods.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of coordinate descent methods in the context of optimization problems. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the method works by fixing specific variables of the optimization problem and focusing on optimizing a subset of remaining variables. This visualization should clarify the subdivision of the original multi-dimensional optimization task into simpler, lower-dimensional subproblems. An effective approach could be a flowchart combined with diagrams highlighting the relationships between fixed and variable components over successive iterations. By using this visual representation, learners can understand not only the sequential progression of the method but also the cause-effect relationships involved in how focusing on fewer variables simplifies the optimization process. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** Learners will be able to describe how coordinate descent simplifies multi-dimensional optimization tasks, identify the roles of fixed and variable components, and explain the practical benefits of breaking down complex problems into manageable subproblems through iterative minimization.",
