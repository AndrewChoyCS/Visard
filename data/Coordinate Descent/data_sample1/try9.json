    "data": "Recall from Chapter 6 the general idea of descent-based methods for solving optimization problems. These methods are based on the process of starting with some initial guess \u20d7x(0) \u2208 R n, then generating a sequence of refined guesses \u20d7x(1), \u20d7x(2), \u20d7x(3) , . . . using the general update rule \u20d7x(t+1) = \u20d7x(t) + \u03b7\u20d7v(t) (10.1) for some search direction \u20d7v(t) and step size \u03b7. In Chapter 6 we covered the gradient descent method, which uses the gradient of the function as the search direction. In this chapter we will revisit descent-based optimization methods and introduce alternative update rules. In this section we will introduce coordinate descent, a class of descent-based algorithms that finds a minimizer of multivariate functions by iteratively minimizing it along one direction at a time. Consider the unconstrained convex optimization problem p \u22c6 = min \u20d7x\u2208Rn f(\u20d7x), (10.2) with the optimization variable \u20d7x = \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8f0 x1 x2 . . . xn \uf8f9 \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fb . (10.3) Before we introduce the algorithm, we introduce some notation. For indices i and j, we introduce the notation \u20d7xi:j = (xi , xi+1, . . . , xj\u22121, xj ) \u2208 R j\u2212i+1 to be the entries of \u20d7x between indices i and j (inclusive on both ends). Given an initial guess \u20d7x(0), for t \u2265 0 the coordinate descent algorithm updates the iterate \u20d7x(t) by sequentially minimizing the function f(\u20d7x) with respect to each coordinate, namely using the update rule x (t+1) i \u2208 argmin xi\u2208R f(\u20d7x(t+1) 1:i\u22121 , xi , \u20d7x(t) i+1:n ). (10.4) 141 EECS 127/227AT Course Reader 2023-05-09 00:11:08-07:00 Namely, we perform the update x (t+1) 1 \u2208 argmin x1\u2208R f(x1, \u20d7x(t) 2:n ) (10.5) x (t+1) 2 \u2208 argmin x2\u2208R f(x (t+1) 1 , x2, \u20d7x(t) 3:n ) (10.6) . . . . . . (10.7) x (t+1) n \u2208 argmin xn\u2208R f(\u20d7x(t+1) 1:n\u22121 , xn). (10.8) This is a sequential process since after finding the minimizer along the i th coordinate (i.e. x (t+1) i ) we use its values for minimizing subsequent coordinates. Also we note that the order of the coordinates is arbitrary. We formalize this update in the following algorithm. Algorithm 6 CoordinateDescent 1: function CoordinateDescent(f, \u20d7x(0), T) 2: for t = 0, 1, . . . , T1 do 3: for i = 1, . . . , N do 4: x (t+1) i \u2190 argminxi\u2208R f(x (t+1) 1:i\u22121 , xi , x (t) i+1:n ). 5: end for 6: end for 7: return \u20d7xT 8: end function The algorithm breaks down the difficult multivariate optimization problem into a sequence of simpler univariate optimization problems. We first want to discuss the issue of well-posedness of the algorithm. We know that any of the argmins used may not exist, in which case the algorithm is not well-defined, and so we cannot even think about its behavior or convergence. Nevertheless, in a large class of problems which have many different characterizations, the argmins are well-defined. We say in this case that the coordinate descent algorithm is well-posed. We now want to address the question of convergence. It is not obvious that minimizing the function f(\u20d7x) can be achieved by minimizing along each direction separately. In fact, the algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution for general convex functions. However, under some additional assumptions on the function, we can guarantee convergence. To build an intuition for what additional assumptions are needed we consider the following question. Let f(\u20d7x) be a convex differentiable function. Suppose that x \u22c6 i \u2208 argminxi\u2208R f(x \u22c6 1:i\u22121 , xi , x\u22c6 i+1:n ) for all i. Can we conclude that \u20d7x\u22c6 is a global minimizer of f(\u20d7x)? The answer to this question is yes. We can prove this by recalling the first order optimality condition for unconstrained convex functions and the definition of partial derivatives. If \u20d7x\u22c6 is a minimizer of f(\u20d7x) along the direction \u20d7ei then we have \u2202f \u2202xi (\u20d7x\u22c6 ) = 0. (10.9) If this is true for all i then \u2207f(\u20d7x\u22c6 ) = \u20d70, implying that \u20d7x\u22c6 is a global minimizer for f.

That is, suppose that for each i, and each fixed \u20d7x1:i\u22121 and \u20d7xi+1:n, the function xi 7\u2192 f(\u20d7x1:i\u22121, xi , \u20d7xi+1:n) is strictly convex. If the coordinate descent algorithm is well-posed, and the unconstrained minimization problem min \u20d7x\u2208Rn f(\u20d7x) (10.10) has a solution, then the sequence of iterates \u20d7x(0), \u20d7x(1) , . . . generated by the coordinate descent algorithm converges to an optimal solution to (10.10). The coordinate descent algorithm may not converge to an optimal solution for general non-differentiable functions, even if they are convex. However, we can still prove that coordinate descent converges for a special class of functions of the form f(\u20d7x) = g(\u20d7x) +Xn i=1 hi(xi) (10.11) where g : R n \u2192 R is convex and differentiable, and each hi : R \u2192 R is convex (but not necessarily differentiable). This form includes various \u2113 1 regularization problems (such as LASSO regression) which have a separable nondifferentiable component. The provable convergence of coordinate descent algorithm makes it an attractive choice for this class of problems",
    "goal": "**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Coordinate Descent algorithm.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how the algorithm systematically refines guesses to find a global minimum of a multivariate function through coordinates, demonstrating the sequential nature of the updates. It should illustrate the relationships between the initial guess, the sequential updates for each coordinate, and the overall convergence to the optimal solution.\n\n**Key Aspects to Visualize:**\n1. **Sequence of Updates:** Show the progression from an initial guess \\(\\vec{x}(0)\\) through several iterations (\\(\\vec{x}(1)\\), \\(\\vec{x}(2)\\), etc.), indicating how each coordinate is updated individually.\n2. **Minimization Process:** Include graphical representations of the function being minimized along each coordinate direction, effectively embodying the argmin calculations.\n3. **Convergence Path:** Highlight the path taken towards the optimal solution on a contour plot of the function, illustrating where each coordinate optimization leads us closer to the minimum.\n\n**Suggested Visualization Styles:**\n- **Flowchart:** To depict the step-by-step update mechanism and the role of each coordinate.\n- **Diagram:** Use a 3D or 2D contour plot to represent the function, annotated with points showing the iterative guesses and updates.\n- **Animation:** If possible, create an animated progression through the iterations to visually depict convergence.\n\n**Educational Outcome:**\nThis visualization will enhance learners' understanding of the Coordinate Descent algorithm by illustrating the interconnected sequence of steps that lead to function minimization. It will clarify the method's systematic approach to breaking down multivariate optimization into manageable univariate challenges, reinforcing the concepts of well-posedness and convergence conditions that are crucial for grasping algorithm effectiveness. \n\n**Objective:**\nEnsure that learners can *articulate the iterative nature of the Coordinate Descent algorithm, recognize the importance of coordinate-wise updates in achieving convergence, and draw connections between the algorithmic process and its theoretical underpinnings in optimization*.",
