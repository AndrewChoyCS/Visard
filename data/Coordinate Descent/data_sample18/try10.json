When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:**\nThe principle that a point where a convex and differentiable function attains a minimum in every individual coordinate direction represents a global minimum, and the iterative process of the coordinate descent method to find this minimum.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of coordinate descent in identifying a global minimum for a convex and differentiable function. The goal is to illustrate how an initial estimate is iteratively refined by minimizing the objective function along each coordinate direction, highlighting the relationships between the successive approximations \\(x^{(k)}\\) and the convergence towards a global minimum. \n\nThe visualization should clearly represent the sequential nature of the coordinate descent process, perhaps using a flowchart or stepwise diagram that shows each iteration's impact on the variables and how these updates propagate through the function space. Additionally, it should incorporate graphs of the convex function to visualize the minimum and indicate the progress of the descent with arrows or paths marking the iterative steps leading towards convergence. \n\nBy employing this visual representation, learners will not only grasp the iterative component of the method but also understand the critical relationship between local minimum evaluations and the overarching concept of reaching a global minimum. \n\n**Objective:**\nTo deepen understanding of coordinate descent, learners should be able to clearly articulate how local optimizations in each coordinate direction contribute to global optimization in a convex function context, enhancing their ability to apply this method in practical scenarios.",
