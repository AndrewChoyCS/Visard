When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in finding the global minimum of a convex function by evaluating one coordinate at a time while holding others fixed.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\n**Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent.** The goal of this visualization is to clarify how each coordinate is updated in sequence while the others are held constant, leading to the convergence towards a global minimum for a convex function. This visualization should focus on the relationships between each iteration, illustrating the steps taken to optimize each coordinate progressively. \n\nA flowchart or a series of annotated diagrams could effectively represent this process, showing the initial estimate \\( x(0) \\) through several iterations leading to \\( x(k) \\). Each step should demonstrate the minimization of the function with respect to one variable while the others are unchanged, emphasizing the concept of coordinate fixing and sequential updates. Highlighting these relationships and sequential processes will deepen learners\u2019 understanding of how coordinate descent leverages the properties of convex functions to find a global minimum effectively.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Ensure learners understand the iterative nature of coordinate descent, the significance of fixing variables during optimization, and how each step contributes to converging towards the global minimum. The visualization should foster a concrete grasp of how local adjustments in each coordinate can lead to a holistic optimization of the function.",
