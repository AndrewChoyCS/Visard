When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The Coordinate Descent Method as an iterative optimization technique for convex functions, emphasizing convergence to a global minimum through sequential updates of individual coordinates.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the Coordinate Descent Method for optimizing a convex function. The goal of the visualization is to clarify how the iterative process of updating one coordinate at a time eventually leads to finding a global minimum. It should illustrate the sequential nature of solving for each coordinate, highlighting the relationships between the iterations and how they converge toward the minimum. A diagram with multiple layers showing each iteration step\u2014starting from \\(x^{(0)}\\) to \\(x^{(k)}\\)\u2014along with directional arrows indicating movement towards the minimum, will be effective. This visual representation will help learners understand the cause-effect relationship between each coordinate update and the overall reduction of the function value, enhancing their grasp of the optimization process.\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo foster a deep understanding of the Coordinate Descent Method by illustrating the iterative optimization process, including the sequence of updates, the relationships between coordinates, and the convergence toward a global minimum within convex functions. This comprehension will empower learners to apply this method in practical optimization scenarios.",
