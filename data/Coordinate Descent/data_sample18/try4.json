    "data": "Consider a convex and differentiable function f : R n \u2192 R. When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of coordinate descent for minimizing a convex differentiable function, illustrating how each variable can be optimized individually while others are held constant, ultimately converging to a global minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the coordinate descent algorithm for minimizing a convex differentiable function. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the iterative process of updating each variable in sequence while maintaining the others fixed, effectively demonstrating how this approach leads to the identification of a global minimum. This visualization should clarify the sequential relationships between each iteration, emphasizing how each updated variable contributes to the minimization process over time.\n\n**Visualization Style:** An infographic or flowchart would be ideal, showcasing the steps of the coordinate descent method. Include graphs that depict contour plots of the function f(x) with annotated paths representing each iteration's optimizations. \n\n**Educational Outcomes:** By visualizing the iterative process and the relationship between the coordinates and the function's surface, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent works to find minima. This will enable them to grasp the underlying structure of the optimization process and recognize the significance of managing relationships among variables in the context of multi-variable functions. \n\n**Objective:** To facilitate deep comprehension of the coordinate descent algorithm, enabling learners to recognize the importance of sequential variable updates and their role in converging to a global minimum within the multidimensional space defined by a convex function.",
