    "data": "Consider a convex and differentiable function f : R n \u2192 R. When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Extracted Core Principle:** The iterative process of Coordinate Descent leads to a global minimum in convex functions by optimizing one variable at a time while holding others constant.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent in identifying the global minimum of a convex function. The goal is to illustrate how the function f(x) can be represented as a series of sequential updates to individual coordinates, demonstrating the pathway taken from an initial estimate to the final minimized state. This visualization should clarify the relationships between the coordinates being optimized and highlight the sequential nature of the updates, emphasizing how each iteration progressively refines the solution by focusing on one variable at a time.\n\nFor the visualization style, a flowchart or diagram would be appropriate, showing each iteration step clearly labeled, with arrows indicating the progression from one coordinate update to the next. Additionally, include graphical representations of the function's contours to visually convey the concept of minimizing along the coordinate directions, thus deepening understanding of how local minima converge to a global minimum. \n\n**Educational Objective:** The objective is to facilitate a deep understanding of how the Coordinate Descent algorithm converges to a global minimum by enabling learners to visualize the optimization process over iterations and the effective manipulation of individual coordinates within a convex landscape. This foundational comprehension will enhance learners' ability to apply the Coordinate Descent method in practical optimization problems.",
