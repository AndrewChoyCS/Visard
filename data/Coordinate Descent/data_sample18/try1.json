    "data": "Consider a convex and differentiable function f : R n \u2192 R. When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a convex and differentiable function through iterative updates in each coordinate direction, specifically illustrating how each step contributes to finding a global minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent algorithm used for minimizing a convex and differentiable function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\). The goal of this visualization is to clarify the series of updates made to each coordinate \\( x_i \\) and how these updates collectively lead to a global minimum. The key educational outcomes expected include an understanding of the sequential nature of the algorithm and how each iteration refines the solution by moving along individual coordinate directions.\n\nThe visualization should utilize a flowchart or step-by-step diagram style to clearly depict the interaction between the coordinates during iterations, showing the updates \\( x(k)_1, x(k)_2, \\ldots, x(k)_n \\) and their relationships within the context of achieving the objective function's minimum. This organization highlights the cause-effect relationship of each coordinate adjustment while illustrating how they converge towards the global minimum. \n\nBy emphasizing these iterative relationships and the progression of updates over time, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and functionality of the coordinate descent method, ultimately reinforcing their grasp of optimization techniques in convex analysis. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep and crucial understanding of the coordinate descent algorithm by visually representing the iterative updates across coordinate directions, helping learners to comprehend how each step contributes to finding the global minimum of a convex function.",
