When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The iterative process of coordinate descent for finding a global minimum in a convex function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent on a convex function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\). The goal of this visualization is to clarify how each iteration progressively refines the solution by sequentially minimizing the function across each coordinate, illustrating the convergence toward a global minimum. By focusing on the relationships among the coordinates and how they evolve at each iteration \\( k \\), the visualization should incorporate a flowchart or a step-by-step diagram that clearly delineates each stage in the coordinate descent method. \n\nThis visual will help learners understand the progression of the \\( x \\) values through a series of computed updates \\( x(k) \\), showcasing how each coordinate affects the overall objective function and reflects the identify of minima in multidimensional space. The expected educational outcomes include recognizing the necessity of sequential updates, the convergence behavior of the method, and the crucial property of global minima in convex optimization.\n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a deep understanding of the coordinate descent process, emphasizing its iterative nature, the relationship between individual coordinate updates and the overall function minimization, and the significance of convexity in ensuring global optimality.",
