When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The iterative nature of the coordinate descent algorithm in solving for a global minimum in a convex function through updating one variable at a time while holding others fixed.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the process of coordinate descent in finding a global minimum for a convex function. The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the iterative updates of each coordinate while the others remain constant, showing how these updates lead to convergence towards the global minimum. This visualization should clarify the concept of sequential optimization, where each coordinate update affects the overall function value. \n\nUse a flowchart or a series of step-by-step diagrams that depict each iteration of the algorithm, illustrating the fixed coordinates and the variable being updated. The visual should highlight the relationship between individual coordinate updates and the overall minimization process, helping learners to grasp how local adjustments contribute to finding a global solution effectively. The visual representation will foster deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanics of coordinate descent, reinforcing the importance of each variable's role in achieving convergence. \n\n**Educational Outcome**: Learners should develop a crucial understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent, recognizing how the sequence of updates leads to a global minimum in multidimensional space.",
