When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of the coordinate descent method leads to a global minimum in a convex and differentiable function.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the coordinate descent method used for finding a global minimum in a convex and differentiable function. The goal is to clarify how each step updates one coordinate while keeping others fixed, eventually converging to a global minimum across multiple iterations. \n\nThe visualization should depict the sequential updates of each variable in the function f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) as a flowchart. Employ graphical representations to illustrate the convex nature of the function and highlight the relationship between each coordinate's updates and their impact on the overall function value. This visual approach will deepen understanding by emphasizing how local progress in each dimension contributes to global optimization, showing the cause-and-effect relationships among coordinates, and demonstrating the convergence towards the minimum.\n\n**Objective:** To help learners grasp the iterative nature and convergence properties of the coordinate descent method, highlighting how updating one variable at a time leads to a global minimum in a multi-dimensional convex function.",
