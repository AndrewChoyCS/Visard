When we evaluate a point x where f(x) attains a minimum for every individual coordinate direction, we can conclude that this point must be a global minimum. This idea posits that with a function described as f(x) = g(x) + \u03a3 Pn i=1 hi(xi) (where g is convex and differentiable while each hi is also convex), a coordinate descent approach could be employed to identify a minimizer. We would begin from an initial estimate x (0) and undergo the following iterations: for each k, compute x (k) 1 by minimizing f with respect to x1 while holding fixed the values of the other variables at x (k\u22121) 2, x (k\u22121) 3, \u2026, x(k\u22121) n; subsequently compute x (k) 2 under the constraint of fixed values from the previous iteration, then proceed to calculate x (k) 3, and so forth, until producing x (k) n from all the newly updated parameters from the superposition of their last computed states, implementing this repetition system for k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026  The last computed x (k) i at each step indicates it has been resolved anew, thus adopting its interval's value from this point onwards.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle for Visualization:** The iterative process of coordinate descent for finding a global minimum in a convex function through successive optimization of individual coordinates.\n\n**Visualization Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent when minimizing a convex function. The goal of this visualization is to clarify how each coordinate is updated step-by-step while holding the other coordinates fixed, leading towards the identification of a global minimum. Specifically, the visual should highlight the relationships between the initial estimate, the iterative updates, and the convergence towards the global minimum.\n\nI recommend using a flowchart style to represent the sequence of steps taken in each iteration, alongside a 3D graph of the convex function showcasing how the updates progressively get closer to the minimum point. Key educational outcomes should include an understanding of how each coordinate's optimization leads to overall function minimization and the recognition of the roles of convex and differentiable properties in ensuring convergence.\n\nThe visual should foster deep understanding by clearly illustrating the progression of updates, making evident how each step builds upon the previous one, thus reinforcing the underlying iterative nature of coordinate descent.",
