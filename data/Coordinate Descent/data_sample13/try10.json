    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle to Visualize:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in optimizing a quadratic function by analyzing one-dimensional cross-sections.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\). The goal of this visualization is to illustrate how fixing one variable (y) allows for the identification of the minimum along the other variable (x) and how this process is repeated iteratively to approach the overall minimum. \n\nThe visualization should include a 3D graph of the function to show its surface, alongside 2D cross-section graphs at the initial coordinates (-1, -1) for both the x-dimension (y fixed at -1) and subsequent iterations. A timeline or step diagram could also be included to show the movement towards the minimum after each iteration. This will help clarify the relationships between the variables and the nature of the function, while also emphasizing the sequential process of convergence, making it apparent how movement is restricted to the axes during optimization.\n\n**Learning Objective:** Deeply understand how the coordinate descent technique progresses towards the minimum of a function by visualizing the iterative steps taken along specified dimensions, enhancing learners\u2019 grasp of the optimization landscape and the effectiveness of this method in a multivariable context.",
