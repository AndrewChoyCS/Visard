    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The sequential steps of the coordinate descent optimization process in a two-dimensional quadratic function, particularly focusing on how changes in one variable affect the optimization in the presence of a fixed variable.\n\n---\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the iterative nature of the coordinate descent technique as applied to the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. The goal of the visualization is to clearly depict the optimization journey from the initial point (-1, -1) by illustrating the steps taken along the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1. This should highlight the sequential process of finding minima within one-dimensional projections of the function.\n\nThe visualization should include a 3D surface plot of the function with contour lines to represent the function's levels, along with a highlighted path indicating the successive positions after each optimization step. Additionally, an inset graph showing the quadratic nature of f(x, -1) during the optimization should be included to reinforce the understanding of how fixing one variable results in a unidimensional quadratic minimization problem.\n\nBy emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships\u2014how each adjustment in the x-direction brings the solution closer to the minima\u2014the visual will facilitate deeper understanding of coordinate descent. This approach will help learners grasp how dimensionality reduction influences optimization in multi-variable functions.\n\n**Learning Objective**: By completing this visualization, learners will be able to articulate the process of coordinate descent, understand the relationship between variable adjustments and their impact on convergence, and recognize the importance of fixed variables in navigating multidimensional optimization landscapes.",
