    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of coordinate descent involves sequentially minimizing a multi-dimensional function one variable at a time while holding the others constant, leading to an iterative approach towards finding the minimum value.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of coordinate descent using the function \\(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy\\). The visualization should depict the initial point at (-1, -1) and demonstrate the iterative steps taken along the x-axis while holding y constant at -1, highlighting how this movement brings the point closer to the minimum of the function. The goal is to clarify the sequential nature of the coordinate descent technique and the impact of restricting movement to one axis at a time. \n\nUsing a combination of 2D contour plots and arrows to depict movement, the visualization can illustrate the function's quadratic nature and the diminishing distances to the minimum after each step. This representation will help learners understand the relationships between variable adjustments and optimization progression, enhancing their comprehension of the cause-effect dynamics at play in coordinate descent. \n\n**Learning Objective:** Deeply understand how coordinate descent systematically approaches optimization in multi-dimensional functions by visualizing the impact of variable-wise minimization and the importance of sequential processing.",
