    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent along axes to minimize a quadratic function, specifically focusing on how fixing one variable while optimizing another aids in identifying the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative approach of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and the initial point (-1, -1). The goal of this visualization is to clarify the concept of optimizing one variable at a time\u2014specifically, how fixing y at -1 allows for finding the minimum in the x-dimension and demonstrates the step-by-step movement toward the target minimum. This visualization should highlight the sequential process of adjusting x while maintaining y, utilizing a 3D surface plot along with 2D cross-sections at different stages of the optimization. \n\nBy illustrating these relationships, the visual will enable learners to comprehend how adjustments in one coordinate influence the overall function and convey the gradual approach to optimality in multi-dimensional optimization. The educational outcomes include a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent operates, improved visualization of its iterative steps, and clarity on how fixing one variable simplifies the optimization process of a quadratic function.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo foster a profound comprehension of the coordinate descent technique by visually representing the interaction between variables in a quadratic function, thus linking theoretical concepts with practical execution in multi-dimensional settings.",
