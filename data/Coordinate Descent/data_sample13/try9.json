    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The concept of iterative minimization in Coordinate Descent using a quadratic function, focusing on changing one variable while holding another constant and illustrating the convergence toward the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Coordinate Descent for minimizing the function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\), using the initial coordinates of (-1, -1). The goal is to clarify how we isolate the x-dimension while keeping y constant at -1 to find the minimum along that axis and show the convergence towards optimization after two steps. This visualization should include a 3D plot of the function with highlighted sections representing the initial point, the movement along the x-axis, and subsequent positions after each iteration. \n\nBy incorporating arrows to indicate the movement and clear annotations for each computational step, the visual will illustrate the relationships between coordinates and their impact on minimization, thereby enhancing students' understanding of the iterative process and its alignment with the objective function. This approach supports the educational outcome of grasping how variables interact within the optimization framework and demonstrates sequential progress toward a minimum in a coordinate system. \n\nThis visualization should adopt a diagram style that clearly conveys the cause-effect relationships and the flow of the algorithm, enabling learners to conceptualize the function's behavior across iterations effectively.",
