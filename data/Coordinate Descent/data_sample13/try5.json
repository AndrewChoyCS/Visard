    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The process of minimizing a multivariable quadratic function using coordinate descent by examining one variable at a time and how this affects convergence to the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query for Visualization Expert:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the coordinate descent technique applied to the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy \\) with initial coordinates (-1, -1). The goal of this visualization is to illustrate the sequential optimization process where one variable is varied while the other is held constant, specifically focusing on the 1D minimization along the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1. The visual should depict how each step brings the coordinates closer to the minimum and highlight the quadratic nature of the cross-section formed. \n\nUse a series of graphs or diagrams to represent the function in 3D, showcasing the contour plot alongside the 1D cross-section for the x-dimension, illustrating the initial point, first step, and second step. This format serves to clarify the relationships between the variables, the sequence of steps taken, and how they contribute to convergence towards the optimal solution. \n\nBy integrating best practices in instructional design\u2014such as color coding the steps to emphasize movement along the axes and labeling key points and gradients clearly\u2014learners will gain a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent operates and the implications of axis-aligned movement. \n\n**Objective:** Deepen learners\u2019 understanding of the coordinate descent methodology by illustrating the importance of variable selection in optimization and the nature of multi-dimensional functions.",
