    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of minimizing a quadratic function using coordinate descent, specifically the impact of fixing one variable and optimizing the other.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent when minimizing the quadratic function \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy \\), starting from the initial coordinates (-1, -1). The visualization should depict the steps taken in the x-dimension while y is held constant at -1, illustrating how this transition occurs in a one-dimensional cross-section of the function. Use a series of graphs to show the quadratic function's surface, the fixed y-value line, and the progression of points as they converge toward the minimum. \n\nThis visual should clarify the concept of how coordinate descent operates by demonstrating the relationship between the dimensions and the effect of optimizing one while holding the other constant. Incorporate both a 3D graph of the function and a 2D cross-section plot, emphasizing the movement along the coordinate axes. \n\nThe objective is to enhance learners' understanding of the iterative nature of coordinate descent and the method's reliance on adjusting variables independently within the constraints of the function's surface. By visualizing the relationships and changes at each step, students will better grasp the underlying mechanics of convergence in optimization problems.",
