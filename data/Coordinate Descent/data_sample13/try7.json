    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle**: The stepwise approach of the coordinate descent method illustrating how minimizing a multivariable function involves isolating variables and iteratively adjusting their values to approach the minimum.\n\n**Query**: Create a visualization to explain the coordinate descent method applied to the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy, with a focus on its iterative process through fixed-variable adjustments. The goal is to showcase how we begin at the point (-1, -1) and first minimize along the x-dimension while holding y constant at -1. This visualization should clarify the concept of one-dimensional cross-sections of a multivariable function and highlight the progression towards the minimum with each iteration. \n\nThe visualization should integrate elements such as a 3D surface plot of the function, showing contours at different y-levels with a clear indication of the initial point and the path taken during the optimization steps. An additional layer could display vertical dashed lines indicating the x-values chosen at each step, marking the improvement towards the minimum. This style will facilitate understanding of relationships between variables and the sequential nature of the coordinate descent method, reinforcing the iterative refinement process in reaching optimality.\n\n**Objective**: Enhance learners' comprehension of how coordinate descent operates in minimizing multivariable functions through visual representation of variable fixing and the stepwise refinements, fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics involved in optimization processes.",
