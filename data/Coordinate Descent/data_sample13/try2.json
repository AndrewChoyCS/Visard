    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of minimizing a function using coordinate descent, specifically how moving along one axis while holding another constant affects progress toward the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of coordinate descent using the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy. The goal is to clearly illustrate how selecting an initial point, such as (-1, -1), and then focusing on the x-dimension while keeping y constant reveals the path toward the minimum. The visualization should depict the function\u2019s landscape as a three-dimensional graph, showing contours of the function, identifying the initial point, and indicating subsequent steps taken along the x-axis. \n\nTo enhance understanding, consider integrating a series of annotated two-dimensional cross-sections, where the y-value is fixed, effectively demonstrating the one-dimensional minimization steps. This visual approach will support the educational outcomes of comprehending the sequential nature of coordinate descent, identifying key points of progression, and grasping the limitations of axis-restricted movement in optimization problems. By presenting the relationships among the variables and showing the cause-effect dynamics of iterative adjustments, learners will develop a deeper understanding of how coordinate descent navigates toward optimal solutions. \n\n**Objective:** Deeply understand the mechanics of coordinate descent by visualizing the minimum search process in a multi-dimensional function and comprehending the significance of directional movement and fixed variables in optimization.",
