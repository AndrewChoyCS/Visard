    "data": "Consider a basic quadratic function for a thorough examination of coordinate descent techniques. We will work with the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + xy and select the initial coordinates as (-1, -1). As the first step in the minimization process, we will focus on the x-dimension while keeping y fixed at -1, forming a cross-section to identify the minimum within that level. Given the nature of the function, this one-dimensional result, when y is held constant, also remains quadratic in form. Observations show that after just two steps, our positions are significantly closer to the target minimum. However, considering our restrictions to movement strictly along the axes, there\u2019s still more progress required to reach optimality.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of coordinate descent in minimizing a quadratic function by fixing one variable and updating the other, demonstrating how moves along one axis lead to convergence towards the minimum.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative steps of coordinate descent using the quadratic function \\(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy\\). The visualization should illustrate the initial point \\((-1, -1)\\) on a 3D surface plot representing the function, along with cross-sections that show the minimization process when fixing \\(y\\) at \\(-1\\) and iteratively adjusting \\(x\\). Highlight the trajectory of each step towards the minimum, clearly indicating the positions at each iteration and the required adjustments along the axes. Utilizing both a 3D surface plot and 2D cross-section graphs will allow for a comparative analysis of movement in each dimension and how it contributes to reaching the overall minimum. This visual structure will aid in understanding the relationships between variable adjustment and optimization in coordinate descent, leading to a deeper grasp of the concept's mechanics.\n\n**Objective:** Students will develop a crucial understanding of how fixing one variable while iteratively adjusting another in coordinate descent affects the convergence towards a function's minimum, fostering insight into the significance of each iterative step in the optimization process.",
