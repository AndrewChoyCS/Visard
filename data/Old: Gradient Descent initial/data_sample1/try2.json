    "data": "Gradient descent is a method for unconstrained mathematical optimization. It is a first-order iterative algorithm for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a trajectory that maximizes that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. It is particularly useful in machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative process of gradient descent to minimize a differentiable multivariate function by taking steps in the direction of the negative gradient.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of gradient descent as a method for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function. The visualization should clearly illustrate the concept of taking consecutive steps opposite to the gradient direction, emphasizing the idea of \u201csteepest descent.\u201d It should also contrast this with gradient ascent, which maximizes the function. A flowchart or infographic format would be effective to highlight the sequences of steps taken in both gradient descent and ascent, as well as the cause-effect relationship between the gradient direction and the resulting trajectory. By visually depicting these processes, learners will better grasp how gradient descent works in minimizing cost functions in machine learning, as well as the importance of directional movement based on the gradient.\n\n**Objective:** To promote a deep understanding of how gradient descent functions as an optimization technique, emphasizing the iterative nature of the process, the significance of the gradient direction in determining step direction, and the consequent impact on minimizing a cost function.",
