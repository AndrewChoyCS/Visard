    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Process of Gradient Descent as Navigating a Cost Function**\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the concept of navigating a cost function in Gradient Descent as if moving through a bowl. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between different coefficient values and their respective costs, highlighting the iterative process of selecting lower-cost coefficients. Use a 3D diagram of a bowl, with a series of points representing different coefficient positions, each labeled with its corresponding cost. The visualization should clearly indicate the path taken to move towards the minimum cost at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThis visual should employ color gradients to represent cost levels and arrows to show the direction of movement toward minimizing cost. By highlighting this sequential process, learners will grasp how successive iterations refine coefficient values, fostering a deeper understanding of how Gradient Descent works in optimizing parameters. \n\n**Objective:** Students will be able to visualize and articulate the iterative process of Gradient Descent, understanding it as a method of navigating a cost function landscape, leading to the identification of optimal coefficient values through repetitive trial and error.",
