    "data": "Intuition for Gradient Descent Think of a large bowl like what you would eat cereal out of or store fruit in. This bowl is a plot of the cost function (f). A random position on the surface of the bowl is the cost of the current values of the coefficients (cost). The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function. The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle: The Process of Finding Minimum Cost via Gradient Descent**\n\n**Create a visualization to explain the concept of gradient descent as a process for minimizing cost in a bowl-shaped cost function.** The visualization should depict a large bowl representing the cost function, with a surface showing various coefficients' costs. Highlight the current position on the surface, reflecting the cost at that point, and illustrate arrows or paths guiding the movement towards the bottom of the bowl, symbolizing the iterative steps taken to find better coefficients. The visualization could integrate a combination of a 3D diagram of the bowl, graphs showing cost values, and animated paths illustrating the progression towards the minimum. \n\n**The goal is to clarify how small adjustments in coefficients lead to lower costs, emphasizing the sequential nature of the gradient descent process.** This will deepen learners' understanding of the mechanism behind gradient descent, showcasing cause-effect relationships in coefficient adjustments leading to cost reductions. \n\n**Objective:** Facilitate a comprehensive understanding of gradient descent by illustrating how iterative processes lead to optimal outcomes, allowing learners to visualize the relationships between coefficient adjustments and the corresponding changes in cost effectively. This understanding will foster a deeper insight into how algorithms function in machine learning and optimization.",
