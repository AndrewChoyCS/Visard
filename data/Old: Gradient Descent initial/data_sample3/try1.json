    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of updating coefficients in Gradient Descent through evaluation of cost, derivatives, and learning rates.\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of Gradient Descent in optimizing coefficients. The visualization should illustrate how initial coefficient values lead to cost evaluation, the calculation of the derivative, and the subsequent update of coefficients using the learning rate. This visual will clarify the sequential nature of these operations, emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships among the elements involved. A flowchart combined with a line graph showing the cost reduction over iterations will effectively convey the concept, highlighting how adjustments lead to minimizing cost. By using these visualization styles, learners will gain a deeper understanding of the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent procedure and the dynamics between coefficients, cost, and derivatives.\n\n**Educational Objective:**\nStudents will be able to explain the role of each component in the Gradient Descent procedure, emphasizing how the interaction between initial values, cost evaluation, derivatives, and learning rates contributes to the convergence toward an optimal solution.",
