    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of updating coefficients in the Gradient Descent algorithm, driven by the calculation of cost and its derivative (slope), ultimately aiming for minimum cost.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent algorithm, focusing on how coefficients are updated toward minimizing cost. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between initial coefficient values, the evaluation of cost, and the directional updates based on the slope (derivative). An infographic or flowchart style would be effective, showcasing each step of the process sequentially, including key terms like \"cost,\" \"derivative,\" and \"learning rate.\" This visual should clearly highlight how the coefficients are iteratively adjusted and convey the cause-and-effect relationship between the derivative's slope and the movement towards lower cost.\n\n**Educational Objective:** Students will develop a deep understanding of the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent process, recognizing how changes in coefficients influence cost minimization through a clear visual representation of each step, thereby reinforcing the concept of optimization in mathematical functions.",
