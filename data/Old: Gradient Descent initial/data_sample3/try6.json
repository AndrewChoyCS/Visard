    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle:** The iterative process of updating coefficients in the Gradient Descent Procedure based on the evaluated cost and its derivative.\n\n**Query:** Create a visualization to explain the Gradient Descent Procedure, particularly focusing on the iterative updates of coefficients based on the calculated cost and its derivative. The visualization should illustrate the relationship between the coefficient, cost, and derivative at various iterations, highlighting how each update brings the coefficient closer to minimizing the cost function. \n\nThe goal is to clarify the sequential process of how starting values are adjusted using the derivative information and the learning rate (alpha) to find an optimal solution. A flowchart or infographic style would be effective, showcasing each iteration as a step in the process, visually representing the \"downhill\" direction indicated by the derivative, and using arrows to demonstrate movement towards decreasing cost values. This visual aid will deepen understanding by clearly defining how changes in coefficients impact cost and providing a visual narrative of the problem-solving journey.\n\n**Learning Objective:** By the end of this visualization, learners will be able to articulate the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent Procedure, identify the roles of cost and its derivative in updating coefficients, and explain how the learning rate influences the speed of convergence towards the optimal solution.",
