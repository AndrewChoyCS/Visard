    "data": "Gradient Descent Procedure. The procedure starts off with initial values for the coefficient or coefficients for the function. These could be 0.0 or a small random value. coefficient = 0.0 The cost of the coefficients is evaluated by plugging them into the function and calculating the cost. cost = f(coefficient) or cost = evaluate(f(coefficient)). The derivative of the cost is calculated. The derivative is a concept from calculus and refers to the slope of the function at a given point. We need to know the slope so that we know the direction (sign) to move the coefficient values in order to get a lower cost on the next iteration. delta = derivative(cost). Now that we know from the derivative which direction is downhill, we can now update the coefficient values. A learning rate parameter (alpha) must be specified that controls how much the coefficients can change on each update. coefficient = coefficient \u2013 (alpha * delta) This process is repeated until the cost of the coefficients (cost) is 0.0 or close enough to zero to be good enough.",
    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The iterative nature of the Gradient Descent Procedure, particularly how coefficients are updated based on the derivative of the cost function and the learning rate.\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the iterative process of the Gradient Descent Procedure, focusing on how coefficients are adjusted based on the cost function and its derivative. The visualization should clearly demonstrate the relationship between the initial coefficient values, the cost evaluations, the calculation of the derivative, and the subsequent updates to the coefficients. Key educational outcomes include understanding how the learning rate influences the speed of convergence and how iterations lead toward minimizing the cost.\n\nThe visualization could take the form of a flowchart combined with line graphs that depict the cost function against different coefficient values. Arrows should illustrate the iterative updates to the coefficients, highlighting the direction of change based on the calculated derivative (slope). This representation will clarify the cause-and-effect relationships inherent in each step of the process, allowing learners to grasp the dynamics of convergence toward a minimum cost effectively.\n\n**Objective:** \nStudents will understand the iterative nature of the Gradient Descent Procedure by visualizing how the coefficients evolve through successive iterations based on the computed derivative, fostering a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms driving convergence towards the optimal solution.",
