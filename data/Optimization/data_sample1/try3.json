    "goal": "### Core Principle:\nThe strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) within its domain \\( \\{ x : x_i > 0 \\} \\) and its symmetry in the variables \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\).\n\n### Visualization Query:\n**Create a visualization to explain the strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) within the domain \\( \\{ x : x_i > 0 \\} \\).** The goal of the visualization is to illustrate the shape of the function in a 3D graph, highlighting its strictly convex nature with contour lines representing various levels of function value as the \\( x_i \\) values vary. This visualization should also include paired plots to depict symmetry among the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\). \n\nThe expected educational outcomes include a clear understanding of how strict convexity implies that any line segment joining two points on the curve lies above the curve itself, reinforcing the concept of unique minima. Students will also appreciate the symmetry in the function\u2019s formulation, aiding in recognizing the implications of equal input distributions among the \\( x_i \\). Using a 3D surface plot combined with 2D contour maps allows for illustrating both the convex shape and its symmetry, enabling learners to see both relationships and characteristics in a cohesive visual format.\n\n### Objective:\nTo deepen students' understanding of strict convexity and symmetry in mathematical functions through visual representation, thereby allowing them to grasp complex concepts more intuitively and apply these principles in real-world contexts or further mathematical study.",
