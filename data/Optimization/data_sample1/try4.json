    "goal": "### Core Principle\nThe function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) demonstrates strict convexity in a specific domain while exhibiting symmetry in its variables \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\).\n\n### Visualization Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) in the domain \\( \\{ x : x_i > 0 \\} \\) and its symmetry in the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\). The goal is to illustrate the shape of the function across its domain, highlighting its convex nature compared to a linear function, while visually representing the symmetry among the \\( n \\) variables. This visualization should include a 3D surface plot of the function, overlaid with contour lines that indicate levels of \\( f(x) \\), and a series of symmetrical representations for the variables \\( x_i \\) to reinforce the concept of uniformity in convexity. \n\nKey educational outcomes expected from this visualization include a deeper understanding of the implications of strict convexity (such as uniqueness of minima) and the significance of symmetry in multivariable functions. Utilizing a 3D surface plot alongside contour maps will allow learners to distinguish between convex, concave, and linear behavior of the function, thus reinforcing conceptual clarity and aiding in the visualization of relationships among variables effectively.\n\n### Learning Objective\nStudents will comprehend the implications of strict convexity and symmetry in multivariable functions, enabling them to apply these insights in optimization problems and understand their importance in theoretical contexts. The objective is to facilitate critical thinking about how these mathematical properties influence function behavior, ultimately cultivating a nuanced appreciation for the structure of such functions.",
