    "goal": "**Core Principle Extracted:** The strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) in the domain where \\( x_i > 0 \\) and its symmetry across the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\).\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of strict convexity in the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\log(x_i) \\) and its symmetry among the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\). The visualization should include a 3D surface plot that illustrates the shape of the function across various combinations of \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) while keeping \\( x_3 \\) constant, highlighting the \"bowl-like\" curvature characteristic of strict convexity. Additionally, overlay contour lines on a 2D plot to demonstrate the symmetric nature of the function in relation to its variables. \n\nThe goal of this visualization is to clarify the concept of strict convexity as it relates to optimization and the unique minimum quantities in a multidimensional context. Key educational outcomes expected include enabling learners to visually identify regions of strict convexity, understand how changes in one variable affect the outcome, and recognize the symmetry among the variables. By employing this approach, learners will engage with the mathematical properties of the function in a visual and intuitive manner, thereby deepening their conceptual understanding of convex functions and their implications in optimization problems. \n\n**Objective:** Students will achieve a robust understanding of the characteristics of strict convex functions, including their geometric interpretation, which fosters critical thinking in optimization scenarios and aids in mastering higher-dimensional calculus concepts.",
