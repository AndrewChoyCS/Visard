    "goal": "### Extracted Core Principle\n**Strict Convexity in Functions**\n\n### Query\nCreate a visualization to explain the concept of strict convexity in the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\log(x_i) \\), specifically focusing on its behavior within the domain where \\( x_i > 0 \\). The goal of this visualization is to clearly illustrate how the function exhibits its strictly convex nature by depicting a graph of \\( f(x) \\) over the defined domain and showcasing different coordinate points (or values of \\( x_i \\)). Additionally, highlight the symmetry of the function across its coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\).\n\nTo achieve this, use a combination of a 3D surface plot to visualize the function\u2019s landscape and contour plots to display the symmetry in various dimensions. Annotate the graph to indicate significant points, such as local minima, as well as illustrate the lines of symmetry. The visualization should emphasize the relationships between \\( x_i \\) values and the outcomes of \\( f(x) \\), effectively reinforcing the conceptual understanding of how strict convexity influences the behavior of the function.\n\n### Educational Objective\nDeveloping a deep understanding of how the concept of strict convexity affects function behavior and decision-making in optimization contexts. This visualization will help students grasp the implications of convexity in practical applications, fostering a richer comprehension of mathematical properties in functional analysis and optimization theory.",
