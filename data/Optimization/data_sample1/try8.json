    "goal": "**Core Principle: Strict Convexity of the Function and Its Symmetry**\n\n---\n\n**Query:**\n\nCreate a visualization to explain the strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) in the domain where \\( x_i > 0 \\) and its symmetry across the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\). The goal is to illustrate the shape of the function's graph, emphasizing how it curves upwards, demonstrating the property of strict convexity. Additionally, showcase the symmetrical nature of the function with multiple lines or plots representing different values of \\( x_i \\) while maintaining equal spacing or patterns in the axes. \n\nThe intended educational outcome is for learners to grasp how strict convexity affects optimization problems and the relationship between the variables \\( x_i \\) in this context. This visualization should effectively highlight relationships by employing an infographic style that includes graphs plotting the function for varying numbers of variables \\( n \\), alongside other visual elements that reinforce the concept of symmetry (e.g., mirrored axes or color gradients). By integrating these visual techniques, learners will develop a deeper understanding of convex functions and their implications in statistical and analytical settings. \n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\nLearners will be able to identify and describe the properties of strict convexity in mathematical functions, understand its implications for optimization, and articulate how symmetry in variables influences the behavior of the function within specified domains.",
