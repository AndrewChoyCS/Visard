    "goal": "**Core Principle: Strict Convexity of the Function**\n\n**Query:**\nCreate a visualization to explain the strict convexity of the function \\( f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\log(x_i) \\) in the domain where \\( x_i > 0 \\). Position this convexity using a 3D surface plot that illustrates how the function behaves as the values of \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) change while remaining positive. Additionally, include contour lines to represent different levels of the function value, highlighting the symmetry in the coordinates \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\). The goal of the visualization is to clarify how strictly convex functions exhibit local minima and to showcase that all such points lead to a single global minimum. This visual aid will facilitate a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables and emphasize the unique characteristics of convexity which are essential for optimization problems.\n\n**Educational Outcomes:**\nBy engaging with this visualization, learners will be able to grasp the concept of strict convexity visually, understand how it enhances optimization, and recognize the implications of symmetry in multi-variable functions. The 3D surface plot helps illustrate the relationships and overarching structure of the function, aiding learners in developing strong conceptual connections critical for higher-level analyses in mathematical modeling and optimization scenarios.",
