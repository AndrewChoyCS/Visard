    "goal": "To create a static visualization that illustrates the difference in convergence rates between batch and online minimization algorithms, I would design a plot that consists of two subplots side-by-side. The left subplot would represent the batch minimization algorithm, while the right subplot would represent the online minimization algorithm.\n\nThe plot would start with a simple function, such as a quadratic function with a single minimum point, to illustrate the concept of convergence. The function would be represented as a parabola with a clear minimum point.\n\nOn the left subplot, the batch minimization algorithm would be represented by a series of points that are generated by iteratively computing the gradient of the function at each point and moving in the direction of the negative gradient. The points would be connected to form a sequence of data points that converge to the minimum point of the function.\n\nOn the right subplot, the online minimization algorithm would be represented by a single point that is generated by iteratively computing the gradient of the function at the current point and moving in the direction of the negative gradient. However, unlike the batch algorithm, the online algorithm would only update the point after computing the gradient at the new point, resulting in a more gradual convergence to the minimum point.\n\nTo highlight the difference in convergence rates, the plot would include a legend that indicates the number of iterations it takes for each algorithm to converge to the minimum point. The legend would show that the batch algorithm converges in a single step, while the online algorithm converges after a large number of iterations.\n\nTo aid the student's understanding, the plot would include annotations and labels that explain the key concepts, such as the gradient descent algorithm, batch minimization, online minimization, and convergence rates. The annotations would also highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm, such as the batch algorithm's faster convergence but higher computational cost, and the online algorithm's slower convergence but lower computational cost.\n\nThe plot would be designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand, with a clear visual representation of the difference in convergence rates between the two algorithms. The use of a simple function and a clear legend would help the student to quickly understand the key concepts and to see the difference between the two algorithms.\n\nThe plot would also be accompanied by a caption that summarizes the key points and provides additional context. For example:\n\n\"The plot above illustrates the difference in convergence rates between batch and online minimization algorithms. The left subplot shows the batch minimization algorithm converging to the minimum point in a single step, while the right subplot shows the online minimization algorithm",
