    "goal": "For the visualization, I would create a static diagram that illustrates the effect of initial guesses on the convergence of a minimization algorithm, specifically Gradient Descent. The diagram would consist of the following components:\n\n**Title Section**: The top section of the diagram would include a title that clearly states the concept being visualized: \"Effect of Initial Guess on Convergence of Gradient Descent\". Below the title, a brief explanation would be provided to set the context for the visualization.\n\n**Gradient Descent Process**: The main section of the diagram would illustrate the Gradient Descent process. It would show a line representing the objective function, with the initial guess (x0) marked on the x-axis. The diagram would then show the gradient vector at each iteration, with the direction of the gradient vector indicating the direction of descent. The line would then move down the gradient vector, illustrating the update of the guess at each iteration.\n\n**Initial Guesses**: To visualize the effect of different initial guesses, I would include a series of parallel lines representing different initial guesses. Each line would start at a different x-value, representing the initial guess. The line would then move down the gradient vector, illustrating the convergence of each initial guess.\n\n**Convergence Points**: To highlight the convergence points, I would include a series of small dots or circles at the points where each initial guess converges to the optimal solution. The dots would be colored differently to distinguish between the different initial guesses.\n\n**Comparison Section**: Below the main section, I would include a comparison section that highlights the differences in convergence between the different initial guesses. This section would include a graph or chart that shows the difference in convergence between the different initial guesses, with the x-axis representing the number of iterations and the y-axis representing the error or residual.\n\n**Color Scheme**: To make the visualization more intuitive, I would use a color scheme where the color of each initial guess represents its convergence point. For example, one color could represent convergence to the optimal solution, while another color represents divergence or oscillation.\n\n**Legend**: To ensure that the visualization is clear and easy to understand, I would include a legend that explains the color scheme and the different components of the diagram.\n\nOverall, this visualization would provide a clear and intuitive representation of the effect of initial guesses on the convergence of Gradient Descent, helping students to better understand the concept and its implications.",
