    "goal": "To create a visualization that compares the performance of different minimization algorithms on a multi-modal optimization problem, I would design a static diagram that incorporates the following elements:\n\n**Title Section**\n\n* The title of the visualization would be \"Comparison of Minimization Algorithms on a Multi-Modal Optimization Problem\"\n* Below the title, a brief introduction would be provided to explain the concept of multi-modal optimization and the importance of choosing the right minimization algorithm.\n\n**Problem Description Section**\n\n* A diagram would be included to illustrate the concept of a multi-modal optimization problem, showing multiple local minima or optima.\n* The diagram would be labeled to explain the different features of the problem, such as the number of local minima, the shape of the problem, and the difficulty level.\n\n**Minimization Algorithms Section**\n\n* A table or a diagram would be used to compare the performance of different minimization algorithms, such as Gradient Descent (GD), Conjugate Gradient (CG), and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS).\n* The table would include columns to list the algorithm's name, the optimization technique used, and a brief description of the algorithm.\n* The performance of each algorithm would be evaluated using metrics such as the number of iterations, the convergence rate, and the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Performance Comparison Section**\n\n* A graph would be used to visualize the performance of each algorithm, showing the number of iterations, convergence rate, and accuracy of the solution over time.\n* The graph would be labeled to explain the different features, such as the x-axis representing the number of iterations and the y-axis representing the performance metric.\n* Different colors or symbols would be used to distinguish between the performance of each algorithm.\n\n**Key Takeaways Section**\n\n* A summary of the key findings would be provided, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.\n* The section would also include recommendations for choosing the right minimization algorithm for a specific problem.\n\n**Design Considerations**\n\n* The visualization would be designed to be easy to read and understand, with clear labels and concise descriptions.\n* The use of colors and symbols would be limited to avoid visual clutter and ensure that the diagram is accessible to a wide range of viewers.\n* The diagram would be optimized for printing and would be suitable for inclusion in a textbook.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the visualization would provide a clear and concise comparison of the performance of different minimization algorithms on a multi-modal optimization problem, helping the student to better understand the content and make informed decisions about choosing the right",
