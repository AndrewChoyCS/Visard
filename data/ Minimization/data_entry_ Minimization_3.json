    "goal": "For the visualization, I would propose a static graph that compares the minimum value of a function as a function of the number of iterations for different minimization algorithms. The graph would be divided into several sections, each representing a different minimization algorithm.\n\nOn the x-axis, the number of iterations would be plotted, ranging from 0 to a sufficiently large number to demonstrate the convergence of the algorithms. On the y-axis, the minimum value of the function would be plotted.\n\nThe different minimization algorithms would be represented by different lines or curves on the graph, each showing the minimum value of the function as a function of the number of iterations. This would allow the student to easily compare the performance of the different algorithms.\n\nTo make the visualization more informative, I would include several key features:\n\n* A legend that explains the different lines or curves, indicating which algorithm is represented by each one.\n* A key or caption that provides a brief description of each minimization algorithm, including its strengths and weaknesses.\n* A table or summary that provides a quick overview of the key findings, including the convergence rates and minimum values achieved by each algorithm.\n* A set of arrows or annotations that highlight the convergence points of the different algorithms, making it easier to visualize the behavior of each algorithm.\n\nThe visualization would be designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand, with plenty of whitespace to avoid clutter. The layout would be carefully chosen to facilitate comparison and analysis of the different algorithms.\n\nTo make the visualization more engaging and interactive, I would consider adding some visual elements, such as:\n\n* A heatmap or color gradient that highlights the regions of the graph where the different algorithms converge.\n* A 3D surface plot that shows the function being minimized, with the minimization algorithms represented by different colors or textures.\n* A set of interactive tools, such as zooming, panning, and hovering, that allow the student to explore the graph in more detail.\n\nOverall, the visualization would be designed to provide a clear and concise overview of the key findings, while also providing enough detail and visual interest to keep the student engaged and motivated to learn more.",
