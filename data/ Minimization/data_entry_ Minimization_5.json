    "goal": "To create a visualization that illustrates the difference in convergence rates between a convex and a non-convex optimization problem, I would propose the following concept:\n\nThe visualization would be a 2D plot of a function, with the x-axis representing the number of iterations and the y-axis representing the objective function value. The plot would have two separate curves, one for the convex optimization problem and one for the non-convex optimization problem.\n\nThe convex optimization problem curve would be depicted as a smooth, concave curve that rapidly converges to the global minimum, with the number of iterations required to reach the minimum decreasing exponentially as the function becomes flatter. This would be represented by a curve that rapidly descends to the minimum point.\n\nIn contrast, the non-convex optimization problem curve would be depicted as a jagged, non-smooth curve that converges to the global minimum, but at a much slower rate than the convex optimization problem. This would be represented by a curve that descends to the minimum point, but with a more gradual slope, indicating that the number of iterations required to reach the minimum increases as the function becomes more complex.\n\nTo further illustrate the difference in convergence rates, I would add a legend to the plot that highlights the key features of each curve, such as the number of iterations required to reach the minimum, the number of local minima, and the number of saddle points.\n\nThe visualization would be accompanied by a caption that explains the key concepts and provides context for the plot, such as:\n\n\"The plot illustrates the convergence rates of a convex optimization problem (blue curve) and a non-convex optimization problem (red curve). The convex optimization problem converges rapidly to the global minimum, while the non-convex optimization problem converges at a much slower rate. The legend highlights the key features of each curve, including the number of iterations required to reach the minimum, the number of local minima, and the number of saddle points.\"\n\nBy using a static 2D plot, we can create a clear and concise visualization that illustrates the key concepts and helps students understand the difference in convergence rates between convex and non-convex optimization problems.",
