    "data": "Visualize the minimum value of a function at different points in the parameter space for a minimization algorithm.",
    "goal": "For the visualization, I would focus on illustrating the concept of gradient descent in a 2D parameter space, where the function being minimized is a quadratic function. Here's a description of the visualization:\n\nThe visualization would consist of a 2D graph with the x-axis representing the learning rate (\u03b1) and the y-axis representing the number of iterations (k). The graph would be divided into a series of concentric circles, each representing a different function being minimized.\n\nThe center of each circle would represent the minimum value of the function, and the radius of the circle would represent the magnitude of the minimum value. The closer the circle is to the origin, the smaller the minimum value.\n\nTo the left and right of the origin, there would be two lines representing the direction of the gradient. The line pointing towards the origin would represent the direction of the negative gradient, while the line pointing away from the origin would represent the direction of the positive gradient.\n\nThe visualization would also include several key points to highlight the behavior of the gradient descent algorithm:\n\n* A red dot would represent the starting point (x0, y0), where the algorithm begins.\n* A blue dot would represent the optimal solution (x*, y*), where the function is minimized.\n* A green dot would represent the point where the algorithm converges to the optimal solution (x_c, y_c), where the gradient descent algorithm stops iterating.\n* A yellow line would represent the path taken by the algorithm as it iteratively updates its parameters.\n\nTo the top and bottom of the graph, there would be two labels:\n\n* The left label would represent the minimum value of the function (f_min), with a smaller value indicating a better minimum.\n* The right label would represent the number of iterations required to converge to the optimal solution (k_iter), with a smaller value indicating faster convergence.\n\nThe visualization would be accompanied by a caption that explains the key concepts and how they relate to the gradient descent algorithm. The caption would provide additional context and insights to help the student understand the behavior of the algorithm and how it can be used to minimize functions in different contexts.\n\nThe visualization would be designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand, with clear labels and a logical layout that facilitates comprehension. The use of different colors and symbols would help to draw attention to key points and highlight important concepts.",
