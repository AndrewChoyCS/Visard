    "goal": "For the visualization, I would create a static diagram that illustrates the effect of batch size on the convergence of a minimization algorithm. The diagram would consist of the following elements:\n\n**Title**: \"Effect of Batch Size on Convergence of Minimization Algorithm\"\n\n**Background**: A simple optimization problem, such as a quadratic function, would be represented as a parabola on the x-axis. The parabola would be labeled as the objective function to be minimized.\n\n**Batch Size**: The batch size would be represented as a slider or a range of values on the x-axis. This would allow the student to adjust the batch size and observe its effect on convergence.\n\n**Convergence Curves**: The minimization algorithm's convergence would be represented by multiple curves that start at the same point on the parabola. Each curve would correspond to a different batch size. The curves would be labeled with the batch size value.\n\n**Legend**: A legend would be included to explain the different colors used to represent the convergence curves. For example, a blue curve might represent a small batch size, while a red curve represents a large batch size.\n\n**Key Points**: To highlight the key points, I would include several key points on the diagram, such as:\n\n* The initial point where the curves start\n* The point where the curves converge to the minimum\n* The point where the curves diverge (i.e., the point where the algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum)\n\n**Annotations**: To provide additional context, I would include annotations on the diagram to explain the effect of batch size on convergence. For example:\n\n* \"As the batch size increases, the algorithm converges faster to the minimum.\"\n* \"However, a large batch size can lead to oscillations and slower convergence.\"\n\n**Color Scheme**: The color scheme would be simple and intuitive, with different colors used to represent different batch sizes and convergence curves.\n\n**Layout**: The diagram would be laid out in a clear and organized manner, with the objective function parabola at the top and the batch size slider at the bottom. The convergence curves would be arranged in a way that makes it easy to compare the different curves.\n\nBy creating a visualization that illustrates the effect of batch size on convergence, the student would be able to gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in choosing a batch size for a minimization algorithm. The diagram would be easy to follow and understand, making it an effective tool for learning and teaching.",
